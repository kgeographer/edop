### competency questions (Claude)
#### Similarity/comparative:

- Find places environmentally similar to Timbuktu within 500km
- Which UNESCO sites share the most environmental characteristics with Angkor Wat?
- What's the environmental diversity across capitals of G20 nations?

#### Constraint-based:

- Show settlements at 200-400m elevation, within 50km of rivers with >100 discharge
- Find ecoregion transitions (places within 10km of multiple ecoregion boundaries)
- Which heritage sites lie in "Extremely hot and xeric" zones with population density <100?

#### Analytical:

- Environmental diversity index by country (variance in embeddings across subbasins)
- Correlation between runoff patterns and historical settlement density
- Cluster analysis: do UNESCO sites favor particular environmental signatures?
