##EDOP Pilot: Environmental Dimensions of Place

### Overview and Purpose

The EDOP (Environmental Dimensions of Place) pilot explores how structured environmental data can enrich the study of historical and cultural places. The central question is not whether environment determines culture, but whether consistent, comparative environmental descriptors can help scholars better understand patterns of settlement, mobility, economic activity, and cultural differentiation across space and time. Conceptually, EDOP aligns with traditions of cultural landscape analysis and longue-durée history, treating environment as a persistent context within which human activity unfolds rather than as a causal driver.

The pilot is explicitly framed as a proof of concept. Its goal is to demonstrate that modern, globally consistent environmental datasets—used carefully and transparently—can support historically meaningful comparison among places without claiming to reconstruct past environments.

### Data and Method

The pilot draws on global hydrological and environmental data from the HydroATLAS project, which divides the world’s land surface into approximately 190,000 nested sub-basins and associates each with a wide range of standardized attributes. From this corpus, the pilot selects a limited subset of variables that reflect relatively stable or slowly changing environmental characteristics, including topography, hydrology, substrate, and modeled “natural” conditions (e.g., natural discharge and potential natural vegetation).

From these inputs, EDOP generates compact environmental signatures for places. A signature is a structured profile summarizing the environmental context of a place or region, designed to be machine-readable but interpretable by domain scholars. The pilot will test two complementary forms:

- Natural Baseline Signature – emphasizing long-term environmental constraints and affordances.
- Modern Signature – incorporating contemporary conditions to reveal divergence from baseline states.

Together, these signatures allow scholars to explore both enduring environmental structure and the magnitude of recent transformation.

### Pilot Corpus and Demonstration

Rather than global coverage, the pilot focuses on a bounded, well-documented corpus—such as a subset of UNESCO World Heritage Sites or comparable historically significant places. This allows results to be evaluated against existing historical, archaeological, and environmental scholarship.

Demonstrations will include:

- Generation of environmental signatures for individual sites
- Similarity searches (“environmental nearest neighbors”)
- Comparative views highlighting baseline conditions versus modern divergence

The emphasis is on whether the results are interesting and plausible from a historical perspective, not on exhaustive precision.

### Scholarly Value and Open Questions

The pilot is designed to surface, rather than resolve, key research questions:
- Which environmental dimensions are most meaningful for historical and cultural analysis?
- At what spatial scales do environmental signatures remain informative?
- When do environmental similarities illuminate cultural patterns, and when do they obscure them?
- How might such profiles complement existing gazetteers, place-based datasets, and textual corpora?

EDOP is thus positioned as a research instrument and service, not a closed model—one that invites critique, calibration, and collaboration.

### Outcomes

The intended outcome of the pilot is a working demonstration, accompanying documentation, and a clear articulation of extension points for future collaboration. Success will be measured not by completeness, but by whether the pilot convincingly shows that environmental profiling can add interpretive value for historians, archaeologists, and spatial humanists studying the past.
