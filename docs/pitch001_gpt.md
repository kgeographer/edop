__EDOP (Environmental Dimensions of Place)__ is an exploratory research and service project that asks a classic but still under-operationalized question in geography and the social sciences: how do physical environments and climate relate to the cultural characteristics of places? Drawing conceptually on the tradition of cultural landscape analysis articulated by Carl Sauer, EDOP treats environment not as deterministic, but as a structured context within which human settlement, economic practice, mobility, and cultural expression take form. The project is explicitly comparative and global in scope, aiming to provide environmental descriptors that can be systematically aligned with cities, regions, historical places, and other culturally meaningful spatial units used in humanities and social science research.

Technically, EDOP begins from the global hydrological and environmental data produced by the HydroATLAS project, particularly its level-9 basin framework, which partitions the world’s land surface into roughly 190,000 sub-basins. Each basin carries dozens of standardized attributes describing climate, hydrology, topography, and land characteristics. EDOP’s initial goal is to identify a defensible subset of these attributes and use them to generate compact “environmental profiles” or signatures for places. These profiles are intended to be machine-readable and analytically flexible, supporting similarity search, clustering, and constraint-based queries across large numbers of places while remaining interpretable to domain scholars.

The open research questions are deliberately central to the project rather than deferred: Which environmental variables are meaningful at the scales relevant to historians, archaeologists, and humanists? Do such profiles add explanatory or comparative power when linked to gazetteers, historical datasets, or cultural corpora? Where do environmental correlations illuminate cultural patterns, and where do they fail—or mislead? EDOP is therefore framed not as a finished model but as a research instrument: a platform for testing how environmental structure can (or cannot) enrich spatial humanities and social-science inquiry, and for determining whether such an approach has durable scholarly and infrastructural value across projects and institutions.

EDOP was conceived by Karl Grossner, PhD, a geographer and digital humanities research developer. At this exploratory stage Grossner is its sole developer, but he plans to actively seek institutional support via a few erstwhile colleagues in the US and Europe.
