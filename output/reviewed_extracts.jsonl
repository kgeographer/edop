{"eco_id": 723, "eco_name": "Al-Hajar montane woodlands and shrublands", "wiki_title": "Al Hajar montane woodlands", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hajar_montane_woodlands", "extract_text": "Al Hajar montane woodlands is a temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands ecoregion in the Hajar Mountains of the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, which extends across portions of Oman and the U.A.E.\n\n\nGeography\nThe ecoregion includes the upper elevations of the Hajar Mountains. The mountains form an arc from northwest to southeast through portions of Oman and the U.A.E., extending over 500 kilometres (310 miles) in length. The mountains run parallel to the coast of the Gulf of Oman, with the Al Batinah Region in the coastal plain between the mountains and the sea.\nAl Hajar al Gharbi, or the Western Hajar, extend from the Musandam Peninsula at the northeastern tip of Arabia, through the eastern UAE and northern Oman. Al Hajar ash Sharqi, or the Eastern Hajar, extends eastwards towards Ras al Hadd, the easternmost point in Oman and Arabia. The Sama'il Gap separates the eastern and western portions of the range. The limestone massifs of Jebel Shams (2,997 m (9,833 ft)) and Jebel Akhdar (2,980 m (9,780 ft)), located just west of the Sumail Gap, are the highest peaks in the range. The highest peak in the eastern Hajar is 2,152 metres (7,060 feet).\nThe mountains are composed mostly of Cretaceous limestone, together with outcrops of metamorphic and igneous rocks, including grey-brown ophiolites. The Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desert ecoregion surrounds the montane woodlands at lower elevations.\n\n\nClimate\nThe ecoregion has a semi-arid temperate climate, transitioning to subtropical at lower elevations. The coolest months are December through March, when the mountains receive thunderstorms, rain, hailstorms and occasional snow, particularly at higher elevations. April to September are warmer, with occasional rainstorms brought by the Indian Ocean monsoons.\n\n\nFlora\nThe natural vegetation types include shrubland and open woodland and the flora varies with elevation and underlying geology.\nOpen woodlands with Olea europaea, Sideroxylon mascatense and Dodonaea viscosa extend from 1,100 to 2,500 metres elevation. Ziziphus spina-christi, Prosopis cineraria, Vachellia tortilis and Ficus salicifolia and other species of fig are found in seasonal watercourses (wadis). Euphorbia larica predominates on steep slopes, along with Vachellia tortilis, V. gerrardi, and Periploca aphylla.\nMontane woodlands occur on the high peaks between 2,100 and 3,000 metres elevation. Juniperus seravschanica is the characteristic tree, sometimes mixed with Olea europaea.\nOn the Musandam Peninsula, semi-evergreen woodlands above 1,300 metres elevation were formerly dominated by Sideroxylon mascatense, but now Dodonaea viscosa is predominant in the degraded woodlands. Between 1,800 and 2,000 metres elevation, Prunus arabica forms woodlands with Ephedra pachyclada and a dense ground layer of the shrub Artemisia sieberi.\nCeratonia oreothauma subsp. oreothauma is an endemic subspecies of the tree found only in a single valley on Jebel Aswad in the eastern Hajar. The other subspecies occurs in Somalia.\nEndemic and near-endemic species include Herniaria maskatensis, Pteropyrum scoparium, Rumex limoniastrum, Dionysia mira, Tephrosia haussknechtii, Searsia aucheri, Polygala mascatensis, Convolvulus ulicinus, Teucrium mascatense, Verbascum akdarense, Iphiona horrida, Schweinfurthia imbricata, and Ziziphus hajarensis. Wider-ranging native species include Limonium axillare, Ochradiscus aucheri, Sideroxylon mascatense, Convolvulus virgatus, Salvia macilenta, Viola cinerea, Cometes surattensis, Capparis spinosa var. mucronifolia, Cleome rupicola, Ebenus stellata, Taverniera glabra, Barleria aucheriana, and Pluchea arabica. Many species are shared with the South Iran Nubo–Sindian desert and semi-desert ecoregion to the north across the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman.\n\n\nFauna\nThe Arabian tahr (Arabitragus jayakari) is endemic to the region. Other large mammals occur in small numbers, including the Mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), particularly in the Wadi Sareen Reserve, Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) and Arabian wildcat (Felis lybica lybica).\nFive species of lizards are endemic to the mountains – Emirati leaf-toed gecko (Asaccus caudivolvulus), Gallagher's gecko (Asaccus gallagheri), Oman rock gecko (Pristurus celerrimus), Jayakar lizard (Omanosaura jayakari) and Blue-tailed lizard (Omanosaura cyanura). Asaccus montanus, Asaccus platyrhynchus and Pristurus gallagheri are lizards endemic to Oman which live in the mountains.\n71 bird species have been recorded around the Jebel Akdar, including 28 residents and 41 migrants. Resident birds include lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotus), Arabian partridge (Alectoris melanocephala), sand partridge (Ammoperdix heyi), pallid scops owl (Otus brucei), hooded wheatear (Oenanthe monacha) and Hume's wheatear (Oenanthe alboniger).\n\n\nConservation and threats\nThe ecoregion is threatened by overgrazing from camels, goats and feral donkeys. Overgrazing has limited the ability of the Ceratonia woodlands and juniper woodlands below 2,400 metres to regenerate.\n\n\nProtected areas\n1.27% of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Hatta Protected Area, 28 km2 (11 sq mi), in the United Arab Emirates, and Al Sareen Nature Reserve, 780.49 km2 (301.35 sq mi), and Al Jabal Al Akhdar Scenic Reserve, 296 km2 (114 sq mi), in Oman.\n\n\nSee also\nMiddle East\nPersian Gulf\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Al-Hajar Montane Woodlands and Shrublands Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons\n\"Al Hajar montane woodlands\".

{"eco_id": 810, "eco_name": "Arabian sand desert", "wiki_title": "Arabian Desert", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Desert", "extract_text": "The Arabian Desert (Arabic: ٱلصَّحْرَاء ٱلْعَرَبِيَّة) is a vast desert wilderness in West Asia that occupies almost the entire Arabian Peninsula with an area of 2,330,000 square kilometers (900,000 sq mi). It stretches from Yemen to the Persian Gulf and Oman to Jordan and Iraq. It is the fourth largest desert in the world and the largest in Asia. At its center is Ar-Rub' al-Khali (The Empty Quarter), one of the largest continuous bodies of sand in the world. It is an extension of the Sahara Desert.\nGazelles, oryx, sand cats, and spiny-tailed lizards are just some of the desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment, which features everything from red dunes to deadly quicksand. The climate is mostly dry (the major part receives around 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain per year, but some very rare places receive as little as 50 mm), and temperatures oscillate between very high heat and seasonal night time freezes. It is part of the deserts and xeric shrublands biome and lie in biogeographical realms of the Palearctic (northern part) and Afrotropical (southern part).\nThe Arabian Desert ecoregion has little biodiversity, although a few endemic plants grow here. Many species, such as the striped hyena, jackal and honey badger, have died out as a result of hunting, habitat destruction, overgrazing by livestock, off-road driving, and human encroachment on their habitat. Other species, such as the Arabian sand gazelle, have been successfully re-introduced and are protected at reserves.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe desert lies mostly in Saudi Arabia and covers most of the country. It extends into neighboring southern Iraq, southern Jordan, central Qatar, most of the Abu Dhabi emirate in the United Arab Emirates, western Oman, and northeastern Yemen. The ecoregion also includes most of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and the adjacent Negev desert in southern Israel.\nThe Rub' al-Khali desert is a sedimentary basin stretching along a south-west to north-east axis across the Arabian Shelf. At an altitude of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), rock landscapes yield to the Rub' al-Khali, a vast stretch of sand whose extreme southern point crosses the center of Yemen. The sand overlies gravel or gypsum plains and the dunes reach maximum heights of up to 250 m (820 ft). The sands are predominantly silicates, composed of 80 to 90% quartz and the remainder feldspar, whose iron oxide-coated grains color the sands orange, purple, and red.\nA corridor of sandy terrain known as the Ad-Dahna desert connects the An-Nafud desert (65,000 km2 or 40,389 square miles) in the north of Saudi Arabia to the Rub' al-Khali in the south-east. The Tuwaiq escarpment is an 800 km (500 mi) arc that includes limestone cliffs, plateaus, and canyons. There are brackish salt flats, including the quicksands of Umm al Samim. The Sharqiya Sands, formerly known as Wahiba Sands of Oman are an isolated sand sea bordering the east coast.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Arabian Desert has a subtropical, hot desert climate, similar to the climate of the Sahara Desert (the world's largest hot desert). The Arabian Desert is actually an extension of the Sahara Desert over the Arabian peninsula. \nThe climate is mainly dry. Most areas get around 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain per year. Unlike the Sahara Desert—more than half of which is hyperarid (having rainfall of less than 50 mm (2.0 in) per year)—the Arabian Desert has only a few hyperarid areas. These rare driest areas may get only 30 to 40 mm (1.6 in) of rain per year. \nThe Arabian Desert’s sunshine duration index is very high by global standards: between 2,900 hours (66.2% of daylight hours) and 3,600 hours (82.1% of daylight hours), but typically around 3,400 hours (77.6% of daylight hours).  Thus clear-sky conditions with plenty of sunshine prevail over the region throughout the year, and cloudy periods are infrequent. Visibility at ground level is relatively low, despite the brightness of the sun and moon, because of dust and humidity. \nTemperatures remain high year round. In the summer, in low-lying areas, average high temperatures are generally over 40 °C (104 °F). In extremely low-lying areas, especially along the Persian Gulf (near sea level), summer temperatures can reach 48 °C (118 °F). Average low temperatures in summer are typically over 20 °C (68 °F) and in the south can sometimes exceed 30 °C (86 °F). Record high temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) have been reached in many areas of the desert, partly because its overall elevation is relatively low. \n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe Arabian Desert ecoregion has about 900 species of plants. The Rub'al-Khali has very limited floristic diversity. There are only 37 plant species, 20 recorded in the main body of the sands and 17 around the outer margins. Of these 37 species, one or two are endemic. Vegetation is very diffuse but fairly evenly distributed, with some interruptions of near sterile dunes. Some typical plants are Calligonum crinitum on dune slopes, Cornulaca arabica (saltbush), Salsola stocksii (saltbush), and Cyperus conglomeratus. Other widespread species are Dipterygium glaucum, Limeum arabicum, and Zygophyllum mandavillei.\nVery few trees are found except at the outer margin (typically Acacia ehrenbergiana and Prosopis cineraria). Other species are a woody perennial Calligonum comosum, and annual herbs such as Danthonia forskallii.\nThere are 102 native species of mammals. Native mammals include the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), sand gazelle (Gazella marica), mountain gazelle (G. gazella), Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana), Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs), striped hyaena (Hyaena hyaena), caracal (Caracal caracal), sand cat (Felis margarita), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and Cape hare (Lepus capensis). The Asiatic cheetah and Asiatic lion used to live in the Arabian Desert. The ecoregion is home to 310 bird species.\n\n\nPeople\nThe area is home to several different cultures, languages, and peoples, with Islam as the predominant faith. The major ethnic group in the region is the Arabs, whose primary language is Arabic.\nIn the center of the desert lies Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with more than 7 million inhabitants. Other large cities, such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, or Kuwait City, lie on the coast of the Persian Gulf.\n\n\nNatural resources\nNatural resources available in the Arabian Desert include oil, natural gas, phosphates, and sulfur.\n\n\nConservation and threats\nThreats to the ecoregion include overgrazing by livestock and feral camels and goats, wildlife poaching, and damage to vegetation by off-road driving.\nThe conservation status of the desert is critical/endangered. In the UAE, the sand gazelle and Arabian oryx are threatened, and honey badgers, jackals, and striped hyaenas already extirpated.\n\n\nProtected areas\n4.37% of the ecoregion is in protected areas.\nSaudi Arabia has established a system of reserves overseen by the National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development (NCWCD).\n\nHarrat al-Harrah Reserve (12,150 km2), established in 1987, is on the border with Jordan and Iraq, and protects a portion of the stony basaltic Harrat al-Sham desert. The reserve includes rough terrain of black basaltic boulders and extinct volcanic cones from the middle Miocene. It provides habitat to over 250 species of plants, 50 species of birds, and 22 mammal species.\n'Uruq Bani Ma'arid Reserve (12,000 km2) is on the western edge of the Rub’ al-Khali. Arabian oryx and sand gazelle were reintroduced to the reserve in 1995.\nIbex Reserve (200 km2) is south of Riyadh. It protects Nubian ibex and a reintroduced  population of mountain gazelle.\nAl-Tabayq Special Nature Reserve is in northern Saudi Arabia, and protects a population of Nubian ibex.\nProtected areas in the United Arab Emirates include Al Houbara Protected Area (2492.0 km2), Al Ghadha Protected Area (1087.51 km2), Arabian Oryx Protected Area (5974.47 km2), Ramlah Protected Area (544.44 km2), and Al Beda'a Protected Area (417.0 km2).\n\n\nSee also\n\nʿĀd\nIram of the Pillars\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Arabian Desert\".

{"eco_id": 346, "eco_name": "Arizona Mountains forests", "wiki_title": "Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona/New_Mexico_Mountains_ecoregion", "extract_text": "The Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion is a Level III ecoregion designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. states of Arizona and New Mexico, with a small extension into the Guadalupe Mountains in Texas. The World Wildlife Fund named this ecoregion Arizona Mountains forests, and classified it as a temperate coniferous forests ecoregion. The ecoregion has a rich variety of woodland habitats and wildlife.\n\n\nSetting\nThe region is a transition region from the lower elevation Sonoran Desert (81) to the southwest and Chihuahuan Desert (24) southeast; the west is bordered by the mid-elevation Mojave Desert (14).\nThe north is bordered by the east–west Arizona/New Mexico Plateau (22), ecoregion which is part of and is the southern region of the Colorado Plateau. The north region of the Colorado Plateau covers eastern Utah/western Colorado and is the Colorado Plateaus (ecoregion) (20). The extreme southern perimeter of the Colorado Plateaus ecoregion extends east–west along the border regions of Arizona-New Mexico.\nThe ecoregion  landscape of steep mountains and high stony plateaus with rocky outcrops from the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona south to the Mogollon Plateau, extending eastwards into southwestern New Mexico and into the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas. Elevations range from 1,370 to 3,000 meters (4,490 to 9,840 ft), with some peaks higher than that. Specific areas include the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico.\n\n\nSubregions\n\n\nChihuahuan Desert Slopes (23a)\nThe Chihuahuan Desert Slopes are found on the Guadalupe and Sacramento Mountains. The lower slopes of these mountains represent a continuation of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem; soils and vegetation in much of ecoregion 23a are similar to those in the low mountains and bajadas of the Chihuahuan Deserts. The lower slopes were once mostly grasslands overgrazed in the late 19th century and subsequently invaded by desert shrubs. Yucca, sotol, lechuguilla, ocotillo, and cacti now dominate the rocky slopes below 5,500 feet (1,700 m). Grasslands persist near alluvial fans and on gentle slopes with deeper, sandstone-derived soils. Water is scarce; the few streams that originate from springs at higher elevations do not persist beyond the mouths of major canyons.\n\n\nMadrean Lower Montane Woodlands (23b)\n\nThe Madrean Lower Montane Woodlands ecoregion covers the slopes of the Guadalupe, Sacramento, Mimbres, Big Burro, and Mogollon Mountains, extending into the Mogollon Transition in Arizona. The ecoregion generally lies between 5,500 to 7,200 feet (1,700 to 2,200 m) in New Mexico and 4,200 to 7,000 feet (1,300 to 2,100 m) in Arizona, with densities of juniper, pinyon pine, and oak varying according to aspect. There are some similarities to ecoregion 23e; however, this has milder winters, wetter summers, and inclusions of alligator juniper and Madrean evergreen oak species, such as Gray and Emory oak. At middle elevations, dense thickets of shrubs such as desert ceanothus, alderleaf mountain mahogany, turbinella oak, manzanitas, and catclaw mimosa form chaparral communities. Other areas are grassy and park-like with mixed gramas and scattered trees. A few small areas of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or southwestern white pine occur at the highest elevations, outliers of ecoregions 23c or 23f. The  Arizona sycamore is also known from this ecoregion. In the west, the Gila River and tributaries have many endemic aquatic organisms including fish, amphibians, and insects.\n\n\nMontane Conifer Forests (23c)\nThe Montane Conifer Forests are found west of the Rio Grande at elevations from about 7,000 to 9,500 feet (2,100 to 2,900 m). Ponderosa pine and Gambel oak are common, along with mountain mahogany and serviceberry. Some Douglas-fir, southwestern white pine, and white fir occur in a few areas. Blue spruce may occasionally be found in cool, moist canyons. The influence of the Sierra Madre flora is seen mostly in the southern mountains and diminishes to the north. In the far south, other oaks appear, such as silverleaf oak, netleaf oak, Arizona white oak, and Emory oak. The summer rains are especially important for herbaceous plants. The region is geologically diverse with volcanic, sedimentary, and some intrusive and crystalline rocks. Endemic Gila trout occur in some of the region’s streams. Livestock grazing, logging, and recreation are the primary land uses. Wildfire is an important feature influencing the forested ecosystems in this region.\n\n\nArizona/New Mexico Subalpine Forests (23d)\n\nThe Arizona/New Mexico Subalpine Forests occur west of the Rio Grande at the higher elevations, generally above 9,500 feet (2,900 m). The\nregion includes parts of the Mogollon Mountains, Black Range, San Mateo Mountains, Magdalena Mountains, and Mount Taylor. The peak elevations are mostly above 10,000 feet (3,000 m). Although there are some vegetational differences from mountain range to mountain range within this ecoregion, the major forest trees include Engelmann spruce, corkbark fir, blue spruce, white fir, and aspen. Some Douglas-fir occurs at lower elevations. The ecoregion has a mixed geology of mostly Tertiary volcanics and intrusives, with only minor areas of Precambrian rocks in the Black Range.\n\n\nConifer Woodlands and Savannas (23e)\nThe Conifer Woodlands and Savannas ecoregion is an area of mostly pinyon-juniper woodlands, with some ponderosa pine at higher\nelevations. It often intermingles with grasslands and shrublands. Although elevations are higher than surrounding ecoregion 22 areas,\nthe boundaries tend to be transitional. The region is generally cooler, with more uniform winter and summer seasonal moisture compared to\necoregion 23b. It lacks the milder winters, wetter summers, chaparral, Madrean oaks, and other species of ecoregion 23b.\n\n\nRocky Mountain Conifer Forests (23f)\nThe Rocky Mountain Conifer Forests are found at elevations from about 7,000 to 9,600 feet (2,100 to 2,900 m) in the mountains east of the Rio Grande.\nSimilar to Ecoregion 23c, ponderosa pine and Gambel oak are common, with mountain mahogany and a dense understory.\nSome Douglas-fir, southwestern white pine, and white fir occur in a few areas. Blue spruce may occasionally be found in cool, moist canyons. In the Sandia and Manzano Mountains, white fir and Douglas-fir are more extensive than in other parts of the region. Current forests have been shaped by fire and fire suppression. It differs from Ecoregion 23c by some of the flora, fauna, and water quality characteristics that more closely resemble the Southern Rockies. The region is geologically diverse with volcanic, sedimentary, and some intrusive and crystalline rocks.\n\n\nFlora\nTrees of higher elevations of the area include Ponderosa pine, Blue spruce, Engelmann spruce, White fir, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and Quaking aspen. The lower elevations have a mixed woodland with species such as Alligator juniper, Single-leaf pinyon, Colorado pinyon, Gambel oak, Emory oak, and Arizona white oak. Finally the rivers and their banks are important habitats for specific wildlife and fish.\n\n\nFauna\nWildlife found here include the miniature northern saw-whet owl and many birds and reptiles that are common in Mexico further south, such as the secretive Montezuma quail. The caves of the Guadalupe Mountains are a specific habitat for beetles, centipedes and other invertebrates.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nThis is a fairly stable ecoregion with about 25% of original habitat still intact although vulnerable to logging and overgrazing. Pollution and reduction of rivers are threatening specific plants and animals including Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii),  the threatened Gila trout (Oncorhynchus gilae), and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus). Logging continues to remove habitat of the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) and the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentalis).\nLarge blocks of remaining habitat include: the Aldo Leopold Wilderness/Gila Wilderness/Blue Range Wilderness and the El Malpais National Monument and Conservation Area in southwestern New Mexico; the Kaibab National Forest, Blue Range Primitive Area, Grand Canyon National Park, the Mazatzal Mountains including Four Peaks, Superstition Mountains, Sycamore Canyon, Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness, Hellsgate Wilderness, Pinal Mountains in the Tonto National Forest and the Galiuro Mountains in Arizona; the Chuska Mountains on Navajo lands; and the Guadalupe Mountains including the Carlsbad Caverns in southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. Much of this is linked and well-protected within national parkland.\n\n\nSee also\nList of mountain ranges of Arizona\nList of mountain ranges of New Mexico\nEcoregions defined by the EPA and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation:\nList of ecoregions in North America (CEC)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (EPA)\nThe conservation group World Wildlife Fund maintains an alternate classification system:\nList of ecoregions (WWF)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Arizona Mountains Forests Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1319025871, "rev_timestamp": "2025-10-27T10:34:53Z", "source": "enwiki"}

The vegetation here is generally adapted to the xeric, acidic and nutrient-poor conditions along the Belizean near coastal zone of the Caribbean versant.\n\n\nLocation and description\nThe ecoregion is almost entirely located in Belize, with a few very small tracts in Mexico and Guatemala.  The ecoregion is spread across several small, disconnected sites.  The inland sites are in the center and north and on plains and lowland terrain.  The coastal, southern sites are more fragmented.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of the ecoregion is Tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification (Am)).  This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year (all months being greater than 18 °C (64 °F) average temperature), and a pronounced dry season.  The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, but more than (100-(average/25) mm.  This climate is mid-way between a tropical rainforest and a tropical savannah.  Precipitation averages 2,000 mm/year.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe characteristic tree species of the ecoregion is the Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea).  62% of the small ecoregion is wet tropical forest (closed and open), 25% is herbaceous wetland, 5% is shrub, and the small remainder is cultivated agricultural land.  In addition to the Caribbean pine, there are lesser stands of Calabash tree (Crescentia cujete), oak (Quercus), Wild cashew tree (Curatella americana), Changunga (Byrsonima crassifolia), and the Paurotis palm (Acoelorraphe).  Tree density tends to be affected by the frequency and severity of wildfires, as the Caribbean pine benefits from periodic low-intensity fires for regeneration.  There are also areas of savanna with low shrubs, grasses, and reeds.\n\n\nProtected areas\nOver 31% of the region is in an officially protected area, including:\n\nChiquibul National Park, the largest national park in Belize\n\n\nReferences\n\nE.

{"eco_id": 565, "eco_name": "Beni savanna", "wiki_title": "Llanos de Moxos", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanos_de_Moxos", "extract_text": "The Llanos de Moxos, also known as the Beni savanna or Moxos plains, is a tropical savanna ecoregion of the Beni Department of northern Bolivia.\n\n\nSetting\nThe Llanos de Moxos covers an area of 126,100 square kilometers (48,700 sq mi) in the lowlands of northern Bolivia, with small portions in neighboring Brazil and Peru. Most of the Llanos de Moxos lies within the departments of El Beni, Cochabamba, La Paz, Pando, and Santa Cruz. The Llanos de Moxos occupies the southwestern corner of the Amazon basin, and the region is crossed by numerous rivers that drain the eastern slope of the Andes Mountains. The low relief of the savannas, coupled with wet season rains and snowmelt from the Andes, causes up to half the land to flood seasonally.\nThe Llanos de Moxos is surrounded by tropical moist forests; the Southwestern Amazonian moist forests to the north, west, and south, and the Madeira-Tapajós moist forests to the east.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of the Llanos de Moxos is tropical, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season generally extends from December to May, and annual rainfall ranges from 1300 mm in the east to 2500 mm in the west.\n\n\nFlora\nThe ecoregion comprises a mosaic of savannas and wetlands, with islands of forest and gallery forests along rivers. Flooding and fire are important ecological factors.\n\n\nFauna\nThe ecoregion is home to the blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis), which is critically endangered.\n\n\nPeople\n\nThe Llanos de Moxos was the setting for pre-Columbian agriculture, and appears to have been an early center of plant domestication. The inhabitants constructed agricultural earthworks: raised fields, causeways, canals, and about 4700 forested mounds over a 50,000 square kilometer area. Construction lasted from about 8850 BCE to about 1450 CE. Cultivation included manioc from about 8350 BCE, squash from about 8250 BCE, and maize from about 4,850 BCE. Several domestic crops, including manioc, squash, peanut, some varieties of chili and some beans, are genetically very close to wild species living in the Llanos de Moxos, suggesting that they were domesticated there. The people made decorated pottery, wove cotton cloth, and in some places buried their dead in large urns.\nAlthough Europeans arrived in South America in the late 15th century, they did not come to settle in the Llanos de Moxos until the late 17th century. The missions established by Jesuit missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries became many of the modern towns in the region.\nSince the 1950s, ranching has become the most important industry, and ranches dominate the landscape.\n\n\nJesuit Missions of Moxos\n\nEuropean immigrants began to settle in the Llanos de Moxos in the 17th century. In 1675 the Jesuit priests Pedro Marbán and Cirpriano Barace began missionary work among the peoples they found in between the Marmoré and Guapay rivers, after having departed from Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The Jesuit Missions of Moxos are located in the Llanos de Moxos, while the Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos are in the Chiquitania region to the southeast.\n\n\nConservation and threats\nA 2017 assessment found that 96,126 km2, or 77%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.\n\n\nSee also\nChiquitania\nJesuit Missions of Chiquitos\n1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus\nMamoré–Guaporé linguistic area\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Beni Savanna Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons\n\"Beni savanna\".

{"eco_id": 182, "eco_name": "Brigalow tropical savanna", "wiki_title": "Brigalow Belt", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigalow_Belt", "extract_text": "The Brigalow Belt is a wide band of acacia-wooded grassland that runs between tropical rainforest of the coast and the semi-arid interior of Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia. The \nInterim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) divides the Brigalow Belt into two IBRA regions, or bioregions,  Brigalow Belt North (BBN) and Brigalow Belt South (BBS). The North and South Brigalow Belt are two of the 85 bioregions across Australia and the 15 bioregions in Queensland. Together they form most of the Brigalow tropical savanna ecoregion.\n\n\nLocation and description\nThe Northern Brigalow Belt covers just over 135,000 square kilometres (52,124 sq mi) and runs from just north of Townsville to Emerald and Rockhampton on the Tropic of Capricorn, while the Southern Brigalow Belt runs from there down to the Queensland/New South Wales border and a little beyond, until the habitat becomes the eucalyptus dominated Eastern Australian temperate forests.\nThis large, complex strip of countryside covers an area of undulating to rugged slopes, consisting of ranges as well as plains of ancient sand and clay deposits, basalt and alluvium. The Northern Brigalow Belt includes the coal producing Bowen Basin, with the nearby Drummond Basin and the fertile Peak Downs areas. The southern belt, which begins with the sandstone gorges of the Carnarvon Range of the Great Dividing Range, runs into the huge Great Artesian Basin. The south-west side includes the farming area of Darling Downs.\nA number of important rivers drain the Brigalow Belt. The large Fitzroy River system and the Belyando and Burdekin rivers near the tropics all drain eastwards, while the south-western areas drain westwards into the Murray–Darling basin via the Maranoa, Warrego and Condamine Rivers.\nIn the north, there are tropical summer rains and warm weather all year round, while in the south the winter is slightly cooler and there is more rainfall outside of the summer months. Throughout the belt, the interior, with  less than 500 mm of rainfall per year, is drier than the coast, which may have 750 mm or more.\n\n\nFlora\n\nThe characteristic plant communities are woodlands of highly water stress tolerant brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), a slender acacia tree which thrives on the clay soil and once covered much of the area especially the fertile lowlands. Most of the brigalow has been cleared to make agricultural land, but the Queensland Bottle Tree is often left uncleared due to its leaves being fodder for cattle. Eucalypt woodlands of silver-leaved and narrow-leaved ironbarks, poplar box and other boxes, blackbutt and coolibah are also intact primarily on the higher slopes.\nDichanthium grasslands are another typical habitat of the area while pockets of thicker woodland of brigalow mixed with Casuarina cristata and ooline occur in moister valleys and vine thickets, wetlands, and softwood scrubs are sometimes found although in their undeveloped state, these specialised micro-habitats are rare today. There is a particularly rich variety of habitats in areas such as Isla Gorge  and Blackdown Tableland in the sandstone belt of the Carnarvon Range. The Northern Brigalow Belt is one of fifteen national biodiversity hotspots in Australia.\n\n\nFauna\nThe region is home to the unadorned rock-wallaby and the black-striped wallaby, which lives in the areas of vine thicket along with a wingless dung beetle (Onthophagus apterus). Two endangered mammals are found in the Brigalow Belt; the bridled nail-tail wallaby in Taunton and Idalia National Parks, and the burrowing northern hairy-nosed wombat in the grassland and eucalyptus of Epping Forest National Park. There are also populations of dunnart, wallaby, bat and koala. Birds found here include black-throated finch and russet-tailed thrush, while endemic reptiles include the Fitzroy River turtle.\nA variety of spiders and insects are found there, including Euoplos dignitas, an armoured trapdoor spider discovered in 2023.\nAlready extinct fauna include the white-footed rabbit-rat and the Darling Downs hopping mouse.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nTogether with the Mulga Lands, the Brigalow Belt are where most of Queensland's land clearing is occurring. Much of the brigalow woodland has been cleared or radically reduced to the extent that some wildlife, failing to thrive in the altered environment, has become extinct here with a number of the remaining communities threatened or endangered. The clearance of brigalow and poplar box is ongoing as there are a number of nature reserves of which do protect the various types of habitat found in the Belt including brigalow and eucalyptus woodland, grassland, vine thicket, high peaks, sandstone gorges and wetlands however these tend to be located on the sandstone uplands rather than the fertile lowlands, where the brigalow woodlands are still vulnerable to clearance and are often limited to small areas of parkland. The grasslands of the region are also under threat from introduced pasture grasses such as buffelgrass and weeds such as Congress weed. One particular threat comes from alterations to natural flow patterns caused by the addition of dams and weirs which impact the riverine and floodplain plant and animal species.\n\n\nProtected areas\nA little more than two per cent of the Brigalow Belt lies within national parks and other protected areas.  The largest national parks in the Brigalow Belt are: Taunton (the largest at 115 km2); Epping Forest, Dipperu, Bowling Green Bay, Goodedulla National Park, Chesterton Range National Park, Homevale National Park, Blackdown Tableland National Park, Expedition National Park, and Carnarvon National Park.\n\n\nSubregions\nIBRA subregions of the Brigalow Belt North include Townsville Plains, Bogie River Hills, Cape River Hills, Beucazon Hills, Wyarra Hills, Northern Bowen Basin, Belyando Downs, Upper Belyando Floodout, Anakie Inlier, Basalt Downs, Isaac–Comet Downs, Nebo–Connors Ranges, South Drummond Basin and Marlborough Plains.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\"Australia's Biogeographical Regions\".

{"eco_id": 691, "eco_name": "Caledon conifer forests", "wiki_title": "Caledonian Forest", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_Forest", "extract_text": "The Caledonian Forest is the ancient (old-growth) temperate forest of Scotland. The forest today is a reduced-extent version of the pre-human-settlement forest, existing in several dozen remnant areas.\nThe Scots pines of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the Late Glacial; arriving about 7000 BCE. The forest reached its maximum extent about 5000 BC after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier. This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by 2000 BC. From that date, human actions (including the grazing effects of sheep and deer) together with further climate shifts reduced it to its current extent. Exactly how far human activity should be blamed is difficult to determine (discussed below).\nThe forest exists as 35 remnants, as authenticated by Steven & Carlisle (1959) (or 84 remnants, including later subjective subdivisions of the 35) covering about 180 square kilometres (69 sq mi) or 18,000 hectares (44,000 acres). The Scots pines of these remnants are, by definition, directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the ice age. These remnants have adapted genetically to different Scottish environments, and as such, are globally unique; their ecological characteristics form an unbroken, 9000-year chain of natural evolution with a distinct variety of soils, vegetation, and animals.\nTo a great extent the remnants survived on land that was either too steep, too rocky, or too remote to be agriculturally useful. The largest remnants are in Strathspey and Strath Dee on highly acidic, freely drained glacial deposits that are of little value for cultivation and domestic stock. An examination of the earliest maps of Scotland suggests that the extent of the Caledonian Forest remnants has changed little since 1600 AD.\nThe extent and nature of the ancient forest is much contested, as are the reasons for its decline. Authorities including Christopher Smout (of the Institute for Environmental History at St Andrews University) and Dr Alan Macdonald of Dundee University have pointed to the difficulty of defining a 'forest' and how that may be distinguished from an open landscape with varying degrees of light tree cover, and have argued that the idea of a continuous forest - sometimes called the Old Wood or the Great Wood of Caledon - covering much of Northern Scotland is 'myth'.\nMuch rhetoric has been introduced into the arguments regarding the destruction of the forest. Mabey claims that 'it was exploitation by the English that led to the destruction of the Old Wood of Caledon' and that this began in the 17th century, first to provide charcoal for iron foundries and then timber during the Napoleonic wars. But the evidence for this is poor. Extensive research (summarised by e.g. Tipping and Milburn) has shown that the decline of the forest had begun thousands of years earlier, and Smout, Macdonald and others have pointed out that Scottish landowners were entirely complicit in the felling for many and varied purposes (for example leather tanning using bark, and building works as Scotland's urban population grew), while as regards iron it would have been economic madness to invest heavily in iron production and then destroy the required fuel resource, and that this rarely happened.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name comes from Pliny the Elder, who reveals that 30 years after the Roman invasion of Britain their knowledge of it did not extend beyond the neighbourhood of silva caledonia. He gives no information about where the silva caledonia was, but the known extent of the Roman occupation suggest that it was north of the River Clyde and west of the River Tay. DJ Breeze has examined the Roman and other sources for 'the Great Myth of Caledon', demonstrating the extreme vagueness of this evidence; it is suggested that Pliny's account may be seen in the Roman tradition of explaining away military defeat by referring to fearsome terrain.\n\n\nDiversity\n\n\nFlora\n\nFollowing the last glacial period, trees began to recolonise what is now the British Isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the Strait of Dover. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of Great Britain for a few thousand years, before the climate began to slowly warm in the Atlantic period, and the temperate coniferous forests began retreating north into the Scottish Highlands, the last remaining climatic region suitable for them in the British Isles (see Climate of Scotland).\nThe native pinewoods that formed this westernmost outpost of the taiga of post-glacial Europe are estimated to have covered 15,000 km2 (3,700,000 acres) as a vast wilderness of Scots pine, birch, rowan, aspen, juniper, oak and a few other hardy species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns, mosses and lichens.\nThe charity Trees for Life (Scotland) has been working to conserve the remaining forest, and reforest areas where it has been lost, using fences to prevent deer from eating saplings. This involves the reintroduction of the full range of native flora, including mycorrhizal fungi that assist soil regeneration.\n\n\nFauna\n\nBeing a unique ecosystem in the British Isles, the Caledonian Pinewoods are home to some of the islands' rarest wildlife. It is considered to be one of the last remaining wildernesses in the British Isles.\nBreeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests found breeding nowhere else in the British Isles:\n\nWestern capercaillie\nCommon goldeneye\nCrested tit\nParrot crossbill\nScottish crossbill\nBreeding bird species in Caledonian pine forests rare elsewhere in the British Isles:\n\nBlack grouse\nRed crossbill\nGoosander\nSiskin\nRedpoll\nLong-eared owl\nOsprey\nRed-breasted merganser\nRedwing\nTemminck's stint\nWood sandpiper\nHorned grebe\nGolden eagle\n\nMammal species present in Caledonian pine forests:\n\nReindeer: Reintroduced in the 1950s.\nEurasian beaver: Reintroduced in the 2000s or earlier.\nWild boar: Reintroduced from escaped farm boar in the late 20th century.\nFeral goat\nMountain hare\nEuropean pine marten\nRed deer\nRed fox\nRed squirrel\nRoe deer\nEuropean wildcat\nInsect species in the Caledonian pine forests:\n\nScottish wood ant: A mound building species in the Formica genus that is almost exclusively found near and inside Caledonian pine forests, as they primarily feed on honeydew that they collect from various scale insects living on the Scots pines found in the forest.\nMammal species extinct in Caledonian pine forests:\n\nAurochs\nBrown bear\nEurasian lynx\nGrey wolf\nEurasian elk (Called moose in North American English)\nTarpan (wild horse)\n\n\nReintroductions\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest to reintroduce animals which are native to but currently extinct in Great Britain, back into Caledonian pine forests. Corporations have been set up to persuade the government to allow this. The long-running campaign to reintroduce the Eurasian beaver to Knapdale in Argyll has been successful, and there is some support for the reintroduction of the grey wolf and Eurasian lynx.\nRecently, some landowners have announced plans to build large game reserves on their land and release the species within them. Paul Lister plans to release Eurasian lynx, brown bear, grey wolf, elk, wild boar and species already present in Scotland into a huge 200 km2 (49,000-acre) enclosure at his estate, Alladale Wilderness Reserve, although releasing top predators such as wolves and bears has become a difficult proposition with local and national regulations. An initial trial enclosure of 5.5 km2 (1,400 acres) was built with elk, wild boar, red deer and roe deer.\n\n\nConservation\nA review of the native pinewoods of Scotland, Steven & Carlisle (1959) highlighted the plight of the remaining 35 ancient pinewood sites, many of which had been damaged by felling, fire and intensive grazing from sheep and deer. A later review in the 1980s showed that further damage had occurred through ploughing and planting with non-native conifers with less than 12,000 ha of the ancient habitat remaining.  A subsequent guide to the ancient pinewoods reviews the conservation story and provides a summary of the management in each site as well as a guide on how to reach all the woods using public transport, walking, and cycling. Much of the remaining Caledonian pine forest is fully protected with most of the forest lying within the Cairngorms National Park. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Forestry and Land Scotland also own several areas of pinewood on their reserves. One of the largest remaining areas is Ballochbuie Forest on the Balmoral Estate, which is protected as a Special Area of Conservation under the European Union Habitats Directive.\nScientific research continues on the ecology of the Caledonian Forest and its restoration.  Populations of the rare groundcover, Linnaea borealis, may be too isolated from one another to produce viable seed.  Diversity of fungi has also been affected by the decrease in habitat. The agaric fungus Mycena purpureofusca is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type. Fire appears to increase the natural recruitment of Scots pine seedlings.\n\n\nLegend, folklore and literature\nIn the Matter of Britain, the forest is the site of one of King Arthur's Twelve Battles, according to the Historia Brittonum, in which the battle is called Cat Coit Celidon. Scholars Rachel Bromwich and Marged Haycock suggest that the army of trees animated by sorcerers in the Old Welsh poem Cad Goddeu (\"Battle of the Trees\") are intended to be the Caledonian Forest.\nIn related Merlin literature, the figure of Myrddin Wyllt retreated to these woods in his madness after the Battle of Arfderydd in the year 573. He fled from the alleged wrath of the king of Strathclyde, Rhydderch Hael, after the slaying of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio. This is written in the two Merlinic poems in Middle Welsh Yr Oinau and Yr Afallenau in the Black Book of Carmarthen. The forest is also the retreat of another character named Lailoken from the Vita Kentigerni, who also fled into the woods in a fit of madness and who may be the original model for Myrddin Wyllt. William A. Young argues that Brocéliande, the forest which features in Chrétien de Troyes' Arthurian romance, Le Chevalier au lion, may be the forest of Celython.\nIn the Middle Welsh story Culhwch and Olwen, the main character Culhwch is the grandson of a king named Celyddon Wledig, who may or may not be related to the forest in name. Another figure from the same story, Cyledyr Wyllt hints at a close relationship of the forest being a retreat for people who suffered from a special kind of madness or gwyllt (Irish geilt). In line 994 to 996 of the story, it is briefly explained, \"a Chyledyr Wyllt y uab, a llad Nwython a oruc a diot y gallon, a chymhell yssu callon y dat, ac am hynny yd aeth Kyledyr yg gwyllt.\" (\"and his son Kyledyr the Wild. Gwynn killed Nwython and cut out his heart, and forced Kyledyr to eat his father's heart, and that is how Kyledyr went mad\"). Though not named directly, the very name Kyledyr Wyllt is close to the two related notions of the forest of Celyddon being where people suffering madness or gwyllt hide.\nIn John Buchan's 1927 historical novel Witch Wood, Scottish villagers conduct nighttime pagan ceremonies in a surviving fragment of Caledonian Forest (referred to as The Black Forest of Melanudrigill in the book) on Beltane and Lammas Tide.\n\n\nRemaining pinewoods\nBain (2013) lists 38 ancient pinewood sites in Britain which have been identified as the most genuinely native and natural. All of them occur in the Scottish Highlands. The Caledonian Pinewood Inventory breaks these down into 84 smaller sub-units of the main sites. In March 2019, as part of the implementation of the Forestry and Land Management (Scotland) Act 2018, the Scottish Government listed 84 sites as Caledonian pinewood in regulations, given below.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nReforesting Scotland\nNative Woodlands - Scottish Forestry\nScotland's Trees, Woods and Forests Archived 2014-08-02 at the Wayback Machine\nCaledonia dreaming, Published: January 2011\nHistory and ancient woodlands of Scotland, Expanding Scotland's woods and forests\nThe Central Scotland Forest\nTrees native to Scotland Archived 2017-01-10 at the Wayback Machine\nTrees for Life Site\nCairngorms National Park Site\nHighland Native Wildlife Park Site\nRSPB Abernethy Forest Reserve Site", "revid": 1329625047, "rev_timestamp": "2025-12-27T02:57:20Z", "source": "enwiki"}
{"eco_id": 566, "eco_name": "Campos Rupestres montane savanna", "wiki_title": "Campos rupestres", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campos_rupestres", "extract_text": "The campo rupestre (\"rupestrian grassland\") is a discontinuous montane subtropical ecoregion occurring across three different biomes in Brazil: Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and Caatinga. Originally, campo rupestre was used to characterize the montane vegetation of the Espinhaço Range, but recently this term has been broadly applied by the scientific community to define high altitudinal fire-prone areas dominated by grasslands and rocky outcrops.\n\n\nGeography\nCampo rupestre (sensu lato) occupies less than one percent of the Brazilian territory, 66,447 km2, and it is concentrated mostly in the states of Minas Gerais, Bahia and Goiás. This ecoregion consists of a series of relatively small and isolated grasslands and rocky outcrops mostly distributed in the Espinhaço Range in eastern Brazil, surrounded by lowland and montane forests. It also forms discontinuous enclaves in other mountain ranges, such as Carajás Mountains, Serra da Canastra, Serra do Caparaó, Chapada Diamantina and many others.\nCampo rupestre is found at elevations from 900 to 2,033 meters (2,953 to 6,670 ft) and is characterized by dry winters and wet summers, strong winds and high levels of irradiance. The soil in this ecoregion is nutrient-poor, extremely shallow and young. The geological formation subtending this impoverished soil is ancient, stable, weathered and diverse; campo rupestre areas occur on quartzite, granite, migmatites, gneiss, metarenites, and itabirites. The soil composition represents a challenge for vegetation to establish; plants must overcome very low levels of P, high levels of Al (in some areas), acidity and low water retention (due to shallowness of the soil). Because of these conditions, the flora thriving in the campo rupestre has developed several adaptations, such as carnivory, C4 metabolism, superficial root systems (to absorb periodic rain water faster), underground storage, stomatal crypts, etc.\n\n\nOCBIL theory and campo rupestre\nOld climatically buffered and infertile landscapes (OCBILs) are areas distributed around the globe that potentially share both abiotic and biotic commonalities. These landscapes are often expected to harbor a high number of endemic, old and rare lineages specialized in obtaining nutritional elements from impoverished soils and presenting biological adaptations to cope with harsh environmental conditions. There are at least three areas located in three different continents that can be characterized as ancient and climatically and geologically stable; the Pantepui Highlands in Venezuela, South Africa's Greater Cape and the Southwest Australian Floristic region. Even though the campo rupestre in Brazil was not formerly acknowledged as an OCBIL area, Hopper mentions \"parts of Brazil\" could actually be identified as this particular landscape. Moreover, the resemblance of this Brazilian ecoregion with the areas mentioned above has been highlighted by other researchers, who suggest that the campo rupestre should actually be formally considered as an OCBIL. The relevance of understanding the campo rupestre as part of these landscapes implies the recognition of common patterns among these areas, which can be very beneficial not only for establishing international collaborative work but more importantly as a way to better understand similar processes threatening the conservation of this delicate ecoregion.\n\n\nFlora\n\nThe campo rupestre ecoregion consists of a distinct set of habitats where open vegetation prevails and is subject to harsh climatic and pedological conditions. Rocky outcrops, grasslands and shrublands account for the most common habitats and are dominated by lineages such as Velloziaceae, Cyperaceae, Poaceae and Eriocaulaceae. Although few plant families predominate in this ecoregion, species richness is high; the Espinhaço Range alone accounts for seven percent of the Brazilian flora, while all the mountain ranges comprising the entirety of campo rupestre harbor approximately 15% of Brazil's plant diversity. The relatively high levels of diversity in the campo rupestre can be explained by the environmental requirements unique to each habitat (or micro-habitat), which vary according to a wide range in latitude and elevation. Insularity can also foster diversity in the campos rupestres; given its discontinuous distribution across several mountain ranges overcoming long-distance dispersal can pose a challenge to many lineages.\nCoupled with antiquity, the diversity of habitats found within the campos rupestres leads to many lineages being adapted to specific environmental conditions. As a consequence, the number of endemic and rare species is very elevated; around 30% of the flora is restricted to this ecoregion. Within the families Velloziaceae and Eriocaulaceae around 70% of all species are endemic to the campo rupestre; a number that possibly has grown over the past 20 years since it was last investigated. High levels of endemism can also be identified by beta diversity analyses, which measure differentiation levels between two areas. A study conducted across three different ironstone sites (itabirite) in the campo rupestre  identified the proportion of shared lineages as less than 5%, demonstrating a high level of beta diversity among the sites.\nPredominance of species varies according to the different soil types. Grasses typically occur in sandy soils, with many species from the graminoid families Cyperaceae, Poaceae and Eriocaulaceae, whereas the rocky outcrops are usually dominated by orchids, bromeliads and species of Clusiaceae and Velloziaceae.  The List of Species of the Brazilian Flora published in 2015 around 5000 plant species for the campo rupestre; according to REFLORA by 2019 this number has currently increased in about 100 species, if the database is queried for plants occurring in \"Highland Rocky Field\". However, due to the heterogeneity of vegetation types assembled in the campo rupestre and increasing knowledge in floristic composition, this number is most likely underestimated and needs to be reassessed.\n\n\nFauna\nIndigenous mammals include tapirs, capybaras, bush dogs, and armadillos.\nIndigenous reptiles include crocodiles, lizards, tortoises and iguanas.\nThe riparian zones offer habitat for birds, reptiles, and mammals that require more water than the plateau species.\nEndangered mammals include fossorial giant rat (Kunsia fronto), orange-brown Atlantic tree-rat (Phyllomys brasiliensis) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).\nEndangered amphibians include Izecksohn's treefrog (Bokermannohyla izecksohni) and the reticulate leaf frog (Phyllomedusa ayeaye) .\nEndangered birds include Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis).\n\n\nConservation\n\nThe main threats to the campo rupestre come from mining, extraction of native plants, cattle ranching, tourism, urban expansion, climate change and invasive species. Because this ecoregion has received far less attention from both the scientific community and the general public it stands out as a delicate area in terms of conservation status. In fact, in 2005, UNESCO emphasized the importance of conserving the campo rupestre by recognizing the Espinhaço Range as part of the Biosphere Reserve, with two-thirds of its 3 076 million hectares constituting conservation units. Still, few scientific studies have addressed the biodiversity and conservation of the campo rupestre when compared to forested regions in Brazil. Moreover, even though tourism has grown over the past four decades due to facilitated access, the general public is still unaware of the ecosystem services this region promotes and the benefits of preserving the campo rupestre.\nMonoculture stands out as another relevant issue affecting the campo rupestre; eucalyptus plantations represent a serious threat due to their ability to thrive in poor soils, such as the ones found throughout this ecoregion. General misconceptions that grasslands and rocky outcrops present low levels of biodiversity, given their dry and \"homogeneous\" aspect, have only worsened this situation. The eucalyptus plantations not only reduce the number of native species but they also promote intense fragmentation of the campo rupestre; in less than 20 years the southern portion of the Espinhaço Range registered an impressive increase in the planted area of eucalyptus (30 thousand hectares), drastically intensifying habitat fragmentation.\nFire in the campo rupestre symbolizes both a threat as well a natural phenomenon; readily available fuel combined with environmental conditions facilitates the occurrence of natural and anthropic-related fires. While fire boosts the reproductive system of some species by positively impacting the number of seeds or seedling recruitment it can also negatively affect the sparse and relictual forests intermingled with the more common rocky outcrops and grasslands. Even lineages that rely on fire can be negatively influenced depending on its frequency.

The ecoregion straddles the Tropic of Capricorn and constitutes the southern part of the Zambezian region. It encompasses most of Limpopo and a small part of North West in South Africa, the Central and North-East Districts of Botswana and the Matabeleland South and part of Matabeleland North provinces of Zimbabwe. The Kruger National Park has a number of 'Bushveld' camps, but these are strictly speaking in the lowveld, as these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Although their limits are somewhat blurred, lowveld is generally restricted to the more easterly parts of South Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\n\nGeography\nThe elevation of this region varies from 750 to 1,400 m and the annual rainfall ranges from 350 mm in the west to 600 mm in parts of the northeast. There are four significant mountain ranges in this region: the Magaliesberg which runs from Rustenburg in the west to Bronkhorstspruit in the east and forms the southern border of the Bushveld; the Drakensberg escarpment that forms the eastern border of the Bushveld and runs from Tzaneen in the north to Belfast in the south; the Waterberg range that is in the middle of the Bushveld and the Soutpansberg range just north of Louis Trichardt. The latter is the northernmost mountain range in South Africa.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nAs implied by the region's name, the Bushveld's grassy plains are dotted by dense clusters of trees and tall shrubs. The grasses found here are generally tall and turn brown or pale in winter (May to August), which is the dry season throughout most of Southern Africa. The undisturbed portions of this habitat, such as much of the Waterberg Biosphere, are home to many large mammal species including white rhino, black rhino, giraffe, blue wildebeest, kudu, impala and a variety of additional antelope species and other game.\n\n\nGeology\n\nThe Bushveld is one of the most mineral-rich regions of the world. This is due to the Bushveld igneous complex, an extremely rich saucer-shaped geological formation that stretches over more than 50,000 square kilometers. This formation contains most of the world's reserves of minerals such as andalusite, chromium, fluorspar, platinum and vanadium. The complex includes the Merensky Reef, which is the world's biggest source of platinum as well as platinum-group metals.\n\n\nFarming\nAs most of the region tends to be dry, the Bushveld is mostly beef cattle and game farming country, with only a few drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet being farmed, usually under irrigation.\n\n\nMiddleveld\nThe term Middleveld is sometimes used to describe land lying between an elevation of 600 and 1,200 m (2,000 and 3,900 ft) and has been treated as synonymous with the term Bushveld.\n\n\nTowns and cities\nTowns and cities in the region include:\n\nBeitbridge\nBela Bela (formerly Warmbaths)\nBulawayo\nBrits\nDe Wildt\nHaenertsburg\nHammanskraal\nLephalale (formerly Ellisras)\nLouis Trichardt\nMara\nModimolle (formerly Nylstroom)\nMokopane (formerly Potgietersrus)\nMookgophong (formerly Naboomspruit)\nMusina (formerly Messina)\nNortham\nPhalaborwa\nPienaarsrivier\nPolokwane (formerly Pietersburg)\nRoedtan\nSelebi-Phikwe\nSun City\nThabazimbi\nTzaneen\nVaalwater\nVivo\nZion City Moria\nRustenburg\nZvishavane\n\n\nSee also\nGeography of South Africa\nHlane Royal National Park\nJock of the Bushveld\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\"Southern Africa bushveld\".

{"eco_id": 167, "eco_name": "Chatham Island temperate forests", "wiki_title": "Chatham Islands", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands", "extract_text": "The Chatham Islands ( CHAT-əm; Moriori: Rēkohu, lit. 'Misty Sun'; Māori: Wharekauri) are an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean about 800 km (430 nmi) east of New Zealand's South Island, administered as part of New Zealand, and consisting of about 10 islands within an approximate 60 km (30 nmi) radius, the largest of which are Chatham Island and Pitt Island (Rangiauria). They include New Zealand's easternmost point, the Forty-Fours. Some of the islands, formerly cleared for farming, are now preserved as nature reserves to conserve some of the unique flora and fauna.\nThe first human inhabitants of the Chatham Islands are the Moriori. They are descended from the Polynesians who settled New Zealand and from whom the Māori also descended. A group of the Polynesians migrated from mainland New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, probably in the 15th century.\nIn 1835, members of the Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama Māori iwi from the North Island invaded the islands and nearly exterminated the Moriori, enslaving the survivors. In 1863 the Moriori were officially released from slavery through a proclamation by the resident magistrate.\nIn the period of European colonisation, the New Zealand Company claimed that the British Crown had never included the Chatham Islands as being under its control, and proposed selling them to the Germans to be a German colony. In 1841, a contract was drawn up for the sale of the islands for £10,000 (equivalent to approximately £860,000 in 2023), but the sale fell through and the Chatham Islands officially became part of the Colony of New Zealand in 1842.\nThe Chatham Islands had a resident population of 620 in June 2025. Waitangi is the main port and settlement. The local economy depends largely on conservation, tourism, farming, and fishing. The Chatham Islands Council provides local administration – its powers resemble those of New Zealand's unitary authorities. The Chatham Islands have their own time zone, which is 45 minutes ahead of mainland New Zealand.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nMoriori\n\nThe first human inhabitants of the Chatham Islands are the Moriori. They are descended from the East Polynesians who settled New Zealand and from whom the Māori also descended. A group of New Zealand Polynesians migrated from mainland New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, probably in the 15th century. Traditions of Moriori genealogy and some features of artefacts suggest that some arrivals may have come directly to the Chathams Islands from tropical East Polynesia. The Chathams are no further from Rarotonga than the Coromandel coast is, and it is possible that they were settled separately during the Polynesian exploration of the South Pacific, with most of the immigrants coming from New Zealand later. It is clear from artefacts and linguistic evidence that the final migration was from New Zealand.\nThe plants cultivated on mainland New Zealand were ill-suited for the colder Chathams, so the Moriori lived as hunter-gatherers and fishermen. While the islands lacked suitable trees for building ocean-going craft for long voyages, the Moriori invented the waka kōrari, a semi-submerged craft constructed of flax and lined with air bladders from kelp. This craft was used to travel to the outer islands on 'birding' missions. After generations of warfare, bloodshed was outlawed by the chief Nunuku-whenua and Moriori society became peaceful. Disputes were resolved by consensus or by duels in which, at the first sign of bloodshed, the fight was deemed over. The population before European contact was about 2,000.\nParts of a carved and decorated traditional ocean-going canoe (waka) were discovered in 2024 in a creek on the northern coast of the main island. Approximately 450 pieces, including rare examples of braided fibre lashed to timber, have been removed, catalogued and stored. Maui Solomon, chair of the Moriori Imi Settlement Trust, has no doubt that it is a \"Moriori ancestral waka\" that brought some of his ancestors to the islands hundreds of years ago. The question of ownership of the waka is before the Māori Land Court, with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage working with all stakeholders on \"their future aspirations for the waka\". The report He Waka Tipua, issued by an expert panel after visiting the site in April 2025, concluded that the waka was of pre-European construction and likely to originate in a period before there came to be significant cultural separation between New Zealand and inhabitants of the wider Pacific. However, more detailed conclusions about the exact age and size of the waka depend on the recovery of the 90–95 per cent that remains buried.\n\n\nEarly European arrival\n\nThe name \"Chatham Islands\" comes from the name for the main island, which itself gets its name from John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, who was the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1791, when HMS Chatham reached the island. The ship, whose captain was William R. Broughton, was part of the Vancouver Expedition. The crew landed on the island on 29 November 1791 and claimed possession for Great Britain. Following a misunderstanding, Broughton's men shot and killed a Moriori resident of Kaingaroa, named Torotoro (or Tamakororo). Chatham Islands date their anniversary on 29 November, and observe it on the nearest Monday to 30 November.\nSealers and whalers soon started hunting in the surrounding ocean with the islands as their base. It is estimated that 10 to 20 per cent of the indigenous Moriori soon died from diseases introduced by foreigners. The sealing and whaling industries ceased activities about 1861, while fishing remained as a major economic activity.\n\n\nMāori settlement in 19th century\n\nOn 19 November and 5 December 1835, about 900 Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama men, women and children, previously resident in Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington) and led by the chief Pōmare Ngātata, arrived on the brig Lord Rodney. The group brought with them 78 tonnes of seed potato, 20 pigs and seven large waka.\nThe incoming Māori were received and initially cared for by the local Moriori. When it became clear that the visitors intended to stay, the Moriori withdrew to their marae at Te Awapatiki to meet and debate what to do about the Māori settlers. The Moriori decided to keep with their policy of non-aggression. Soon, Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama began to takahi, or walk the land, to lay claim to it.\nNgāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama saw the Moriori meeting as a precursor to warfare on the part of Moriori and decided to act against them. The Māori attacked: in the ensuing violence more than 260 Moriori were killed.  A Moriori survivor recalled: \"[The Māori] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed—men, women and children—indiscriminately\". A Māori chief, Te Rakatau Katihe, said in the Native Land Court in 1870: \"We took possession ... in accordance with our custom, and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed – but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom. I am not aware of any of our people being killed by them.\"\nAfter the killings, Moriori were forbidden to marry Moriori, or to have children with each other. Māori kept Moriori slaves until 1863, when slavery was abolished by proclamation of the resident magistrate. Many Moriori women had children by their Māori masters. A number of Moriori women eventually married either Māori or European men. Some were taken away from the Chathams and never returned. Ernst Dieffenbach, who visited the Chathams on a New Zealand Company ship in 1840, reported that the Moriori were the virtual slaves of Māori and were severely mistreated, with death being a blessing. By the time the slaves were released in 1863, only 160 remained, hardly 10% of the 1835 population.\n\n\nFurther European arrivals\nIn early May 1838 (some reports say 1839, but this is contradicted by ship records) the French whaling vessel Jean Bart anchored off Waitangi to trade with the Māori. The number of Māori boarding frightened the French, escalating into a confrontation in which the French crew were killed and the Jean Bart was run aground at Ocean Bay, to be ransacked and burned by Ngāti Mutunga. When word of the incident reached the French naval corvette Heroine in the Bay of Islands in September 1838, it set sail for the Chathams, accompanied by the whalers Adele and Rebecca Sims. The French arrived on 13 October and, after unsuccessfully attempting to entice some Ngāti Tama aboard, proceeded to bombard Waitangi. The next morning about a hundred armed Frenchmen went ashore, burning buildings, destroying waka, and seizing pigs and potatoes. The attacks mostly affected Ngāti Tama, weakening their position relative to Ngāti Mutunga.\nIn 1840, Ngāti Mutunga decided to attack Ngāti Tama at their pā. They built a high staging next to the pā so they could fire down on their former allies. Fighting was still in progress when the New Zealand Company ship Cuba arrived as part of a scheme to buy land for settlement. The Treaty of Waitangi, at that stage, did not apply to the islands. The company negotiated a truce between the two warring tribes. In 1841, the New Zealand Company had proposed to establish a German colony on the Chathams. The proposal was discussed by the directors, and the secretary of the company John Ward signed an agreement with Karl Sieveking of Hamburg on 12 September 1841. The price was set at £10,000. However, when the British Colonial Office stated that the islands were to be part of the Colony of New Zealand and any Germans settling there would be treated as aliens, Joseph Somes claimed that Ward had been acting on his own initiative. The proposed leader John Beit and the expedition went to Nelson instead.\nThe company was then able to acquire large areas of land at Port Hutt (which the Māori called Whangaroa) and Waitangi from Ngāti Mutunga and also large areas of land from Ngāti Tama. This did not stop Ngāti Mutunga from trying to get revenge upon Ngāti Tama for the earlier death of one of their chiefs. They were satisfied after they killed the brother of a Ngāti Tama chief. The tribes agreed to an uneasy peace, which was formally confirmed in 1842.\nReluctant to give up slavery, Matioro and his people chartered a brig in late 1842 and sailed to Auckland Island. While Matioro was surveying the island, two of the chiefs who had accompanied him decided the island was too inhospitable for settlement, and set sail before he had returned, stranding him and his 50 followers. Pākehā settlers arrived in 1849 and Matioro and most of his people moved to Stewart Island in 1854.\nAn all-male group of German Moravian missionaries arrived in 1843. When a group of women were sent out to join them three years later, several marriages ensued; a few members of the present-day population can trace their ancestry back to those missionary families.\n\nIn 1865, the Māori leader Te Kooti was exiled on the Chatham Islands along with a large group of Māori rebels called the Hauhau, followers of Pai Mārire who had murdered missionaries and fought against government forces mainly on the East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The rebel prisoners were paid one shilling a day to work on sheep farms owned by the few European settlers. Sometimes they worked on road and track improvements. They were initially guarded by 26 guards, half of whom were Māori. They lived in whare along with their families. The prisoners helped build a redoubt of stone surrounded by a ditch and wall. Later, they built three stone prison cells. In 1868 Te Kooti and the other prisoners commandeered a schooner and escaped back to the North Island.\nAlmost all the Māori returned to Taranaki in the 1860s, some after a tsunami in 1868.\nIn 1868 Percy Smith undertook the first detailed survey of the Chatham Islands. As well as laying out block boundaries he added \"paper roads\".\n\n\n1880s to today\nThe economy of the Chatham Islands, then dominated by the export of wool, suffered under the international depression of the 1880s, only rebounding with the building of fish freezing plants at the island villages of Ōwenga and Kaingaroa in 1910. Construction of the first wharf at Waitangi began in 1931 with completion in 1934. On 25 November 1940, during the Second World War, the German auxiliary cruisers Komet and Orion captured and then sank the Chatham Islands supply ship the Holmwood, so the wharf saw little use by ships. A flying-boat facility was built at Te Whanga Lagoon soon after; a flying boat service to and from the Chathams continued till 1966 when it was replaced with conventional aircraft.\nAfter the Second World War, the island economy suffered again from its isolation and government subsidies became necessary. This led to many young Chatham Islanders leaving for the mainland. There was a brief crayfish boom, which helped stabilise the economy in the late 1960s and early 1970s. From the early 2000s cattle became a major component of the local economy.\n\n\nMoriori community\nThe Moriori community is organised as the Hokotehi Moriori Trust. The Moriori have received recognition from the Crown and the New Zealand government and some of their claims against those institutions for the generations of neglect and oppression have been accepted and acted on. Moriori are recognised as the original people of Rekohu. The Crown also recognised the Ngāti Mutunga Māori as having indigenous status in the Chathams by right of around 160 years of occupation.\nThe total population of the islands is around 600, including members of both ethnic groups. In January 2005, the Moriori celebrated the opening of the new Kopinga Marae (meeting house).\nModern descendants of the 1835 Māori conquerors claimed a share in ancestral Māori fishing rights. This claim was granted. Now that the primordial population, the Moriori, have been recognised to be former Māori—over the objections of some of the Ngāti Mutunga—they too share in the ancestral Māori fishing rights. Both groups have been granted fishing quotas.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe Chatham Islands lie roughly 840 km (455 nmi) east of Christchurch in the South Island. The nearest New Zealand mainland point to the islands is Cape Turnagain, in the North Island, 650 km (350 nmi) distant. The islands sit on the Chatham Rise, a large, relatively shallowly submerged (no more than 1,000 m or 3,281 ft deep at any point) plateau that stretches east from near the South Island. The Chatham Rise is part of the now largely submerged continent of Zealandia. The islands, which emerged only within the last 4 million years, are the only part of the Chatham Rise showing above sea level.\nThe two largest islands, Chatham Island and Pitt Island (Rangiaotea), constitute most of the total area of 793.87 km2 (307 sq mi), with 12 scattered islets making up the rest. The islands are hilly, with the coastal areas being a mix of cliffs, dunes, beaches, and lagoons. Pitt is more rugged than Chatham.\nThe highest point (299 m (981 ft)) is on a plateau near the southernmost tip of Chatham Island, 1.5 km (7⁄8 mi) south of Lake Te Rangatapu. The plateau is dotted with numerous lakes and lagoons, flowing mainly from the island's nearby second-highest point, Maungatere Hill, at 294 m (965 ft). Notable are the large Te Whanga Lagoon, and Huro and Rangitahi. Chatham has a number of streams, including Te Awainanga and Tuku.\nChatham and Pitt are the only inhabited islands; the other islands are conservation reserves with restricted or prohibited access. The livelihoods of the inhabitants depend on agriculture – the islands export coldwater crayfish – and, increasingly, on tourism.\nThe main islands, in order of occupation, are:\n\nThe International Date Line lies to the east of the Chathams, even though the islands lie east of 180° longitude. The Chathams observe their own time, which is 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time, including during periods of daylight-saving time; the Chatham Standard Time Zone is distinctive as one of very few that differ from others by a period other than a whole hour or half-hour. (New Zealand Time orients itself to 180° longitude.)\n\n\nGeology\n\nThe Chatham Islands are far from the Australian-Pacific plate boundary that dominates the geology of mainland New Zealand. The islands' stratigraphy consists of a Mesozoic schist basement, typically covered by marine sedimentary rocks. Both these sequences are intruded by a series of basalt eruptions. Volcanic activity has occurred multiple times since the Cretaceous, but currently there is no active volcanism near any part of the Chatham Rise. Prominent columnar basalt can be seen at Ohira Bay (one of the indentations in the north coast of Petre Bay) between Te Roto and Port Hutt.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Chatham Islands have an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) characterised by a narrow temperature range and relatively frequent rainfall. Their isolated position far from any sizeable landmass renders the record high temperature for the main settlement (Waitangi) just 23.8 °C (74.8 °F). The climate is cool, wet and windy, with average high temperatures between 16 and 20 °C (61 and 68 °F) in summer, and typically around 11°C in July (in the Southern Hemisphere winter). Snowfall is extremely rare, the fall recorded near sea level in July 2015 marking the first such reading for several decades. Under the Trewartha climate classification, the Chatham Islands have a humid subtropical climate (Cf) for the lack of cold weather during the winter and a daily mean temperature above 10 °C (50 °F) for 8 months or more.\n\n\nBiodiversity\n\n\nPlants\n\nThe natural vegetation of the islands was a mixture of forest, scrubby heath, and swamp, but today most of the land is fern or pasture-covered, although there are some areas of dense forest and areas of peat bogs and other habitats. Of interest are the akeake trees, with branches trailing almost horizontally in the lee of the wind. The ferns in the forest understory include Blechnum discolor.\nThe islands are home to a rich bio-diversity including about 50 endemic plants adapted to the cold and the wind, such as the Chatham Islands forget-me-not (Myosotidium hortensia), the Chatham Islands sow-thistle (Embergeria grandifolia), rautini (Brachyglottis huntii), the Chatham Islands kakaha (Astelia chathamica), soft speargrass (Aciphylla dieffenbachii), and the Chatham Island akeake or Chatham Island tree daisy (Olearia traversiorum).\n\n\nBirds\nThe islands are a breeding ground for huge flocks of seabirds and are home to a number of endemic birds, some of which are seabirds and others which live on the islands. The best known species are the critically endangered magenta petrel and the vulnerable black robin, both of which came perilously close to extinction before drawing the attention of conservation efforts. Other endemic species are the Chatham oystercatcher, the Chatham gerygone, the Chatham pigeon, Forbes' parakeet, the Chatham snipe and the shore plover. The endemic Chatham shag (critically endangered), the Pitt shag (endangered) and the Chatham albatross (vulnerable) are at risk of capture by a variety of fishing gear, including fishing lines, trawls, gillnets, and pots.\nA number of species have gone extinct since human settlement, including the Chatham raven, Chatham fernbird, Chatham Islands penguin, Rēkohu shelduck and the three endemic species of flightless rails, the Chatham rail, Dieffenbach's rail, and Hawkins's rail.\n\n\nMammals\nMarine mammals found in the waters of the Chathams include New Zealand sea lions, New Zealand fur seals, leopard seals, and southern elephant seals. Many whale species are attracted to the rich food sources of the Chatham Rise.\n\n\nDragonflies and damselflies\nOnly three species of Odonata are known from the Chatham Islands, while 14 have been recorded throughout New Zealand.\n\nZygoptera Selys, 1854\nLestidae Calvert, 1901\nAustrolestes colensonis (White in White & Gardiner Butler, 1846)\nCoenagrionidae Kirby, 1890\nXanthocnemis tuanuii Rowe, 1981\nAnisoptera Selys, 1854\nCorduliidae Kirby, 1890\nProcordulia smithii (White in White & Gardiner Butler, 1846)\nAccording to Marinov & McHugh (2010), the poor diversity is linked to harsh environmental conditions, such as generally low annual temperatures, constant strong winds and high acidity in the habitats where their larvae develop.\nXanthocnemis tuanuii is endemic to the Chatham Islands, but close to Xanthocnemis zealandica (McLachlan, 1873) from mainland New Zealand and genetic studies suggest that the two species cohabitate on the Chatham Islands Nolan & al (2007).\nAccording to Marinov & McHugh (2010), the Chatham Island population of Austrolestes colensonis differs genetically from the populations on New Zealand’s main islands, but the differences seem too weak to separate them into two species.\n\n\nThreats\nMuch of the natural forest of the islands has been cleared for farming. Introduced species that prey on the indigenous birds and reptiles are a threat. On Mangere and Rangatira Islands, which are now preserved as nature reserves to conserve some of the unique flora and fauna, livestock has been removed and native wildlife is recovering.\nMost lakes have been affected by agricultural run-off, but water quality has improved and river quality is generally classed as 'A'.\nIn February 2025, the Department of Conservation (DOC) announced a pest eradication project on the island. The project, part of the Island-Ocean Connection Challenge (IOCC), targets three islands up to 15 times larger than any previously cleared of pests in New Zealand. The goal is to remove invasive species, restore ecosystems, and protect native wildlife, including kākāpō, seabirds, and rare plants. The total project cost is estimated at $202 million, with $54 million from the government and $11.5 million raised through philanthropy, leaving $137 million still needed.\n\n\nPopulation\n\nChatham Islands covers 793.88 km2 (306.52 sq mi) and had an estimated population of 620 as of June 2025, with a population density of 0.8 people per km2.\n\nChatham and Pitt Islands are inhabited and had a population of 612 in the 2023 New Zealand census, a decrease of 51 people (−7.7%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 12 people (2.0%) since the 2013 census. There were 390 dwellings. The median age was 44.0 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 99 people (16.2%) aged under 15 years, 96 (15.7%) aged 15 to 29, 318 (52.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 102 (16.7%) aged 65 or older.\nEthnicities were 72.5% European/Pākehā, 68.6% Māori, 3.9% Pasifika, 2.0% Asian, 1.0% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders, and 1.5% other. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.\nThe Chatham Islands had a population of 663 at the 2018 New Zealand census. There were 276 households, comprising 354 males and 312 females, giving a sex:sex ratio of 1.13 males per female.\nThe percentage of people born overseas was 5.9, compared with 27.1% nationally.\nAlthough some people chose not to answer the census's question about religious affiliation, 48.4% had no religion, 33.5% were Christian, 5.9% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.4% had other religions.\nOf those at least 15 years old, 51 (9.2%) people had a bachelor's or higher degree, and 147 (26.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $36,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. 108 people (19.6%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 318 (57.6%) people were employed full-time, 108 (19.6%) were part-time, and 9 (1.6%) were unemployed.\nMost residents live on Chatham Island, with only a few dozen on Pitt Island. The main settlement is the town of Waitangi, centrally located on the west coast, with 140 residents as of June 2025. Its facilities include a hospital with resident doctor, bank, several stores, engineering and marine services, and the main shipping wharf. Other villages include Te One, near Waitangi, Ōwenga in the south-east, Kaingaroa in the north-east, and Port Hutt in the north-west.\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\nLocal government\n\nFor local government purposes, the Chatham Islands and the adjoining sea is known as the Chatham Islands Territory and is administered by the Chatham Islands Council, which was established by the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 (Statute No 041, Commenced: 1 November 1995). These succeeded, respectively, the Chatham Islands County, which was established in 1901, and the Chatham Islands County Council, which was established in 1926. The Council is a territorial authority that has many of the functions, duties and powers of a district council and of a regional council, making it in effect a unitary authority with slightly fewer responsibilities than other unitary authorities. The Council comprises a directly-elected mayor and eight councillors, one of whom is also deputy mayor. Certain regional council functions are being administered by Environment Canterbury, the Canterbury Regional Council.\nIn the 2010 local government elections, Chatham Islands had New Zealand's highest rate of returned votes, with 71.3 per cent voting.\n\n\nParliamentary electorates\nThe Chatham Islands are within a single electorate which sends one member to Parliament. Until the 1990s, the Chatham Islands were in the Lyttelton electorate, but since then they have formed part of the Rongotai general electorate, which otherwise lies in south Wellington. Julie Anne Genter is the MP for Rongotai. The Te Tai Tonga Māori electorate (currently held by Tākuta Ferris) includes the Chatham Islands; before boundaries of Māori seats were reformed in 1996 the archipelago was part of the Māori electorate of Western Māori.\n\n\nState services\nPolicing is carried out by a sole-charge constable appointed by the Wellington police district, who has often doubled as an official for many government departments, including court registrar (Department for Courts), customs officer (New Zealand Customs Service) and immigration officer (Department of Labour – New Zealand Immigration Service).\nA District Court judge sent from either the North Island or the South Island presides over court sittings, but urgent sittings may take place at the Wellington District Court.\nBecause of the isolation and small population, some of the rules governing daily activities undergo a certain relaxation. For example, every transport service operated solely on Great Barrier Island, the Chatham Islands or Stewart Island need not comply with section 70C of the Transport Act 1962 (the requirements for drivers to maintain driving-hours logbooks). Drivers subject to section 70B must nevertheless keep record of their driving hours in some form.\nThe Canterbury District Health Board is responsible for providing publicly funded health services for the island. Prior to July 2015, this was the responsibility of the Hawke's Bay District Health Board.\n\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nMost of the Chatham Island economy is based on fishing and crayfishing, with only a fragment of the economic activity in adventure tourism. This economic mix has been stable for the past 50 years, as little infrastructure or population is present to engage in higher levels of industrial or telecommunications activity.\nTwo 225 kW wind turbines and diesel generators provide mains power on Chatham Island, at costs of five to ten times that of electricity on the main islands of New Zealand. During 2014, 65% of the electricity was generated from diesel generators, the balance from wind. For heating, electricity comes second to wood. In 2013, solar power contributed about a third as much as mains-generated electricity.\n\n\nExternal transport\n\nVisitors to the Chathams usually arrive by air from Auckland, Christchurch or Wellington (around two hours from Christchurch on an ATR 72–500 aircraft) to Tuuta Airport on Chatham Island. While freight generally arrives by ship (two days sailing time), the sea journey takes too long for many passengers, and is not always available.\nTasman Empire Airways Ltd (TEAL) initially serviced the Chathams by air using flying boats. With the withdrawal of TEAL, the RNZAF maintained an infrequent service with Short Sunderland flying boats. NZ4111 was damaged on takeoff from Te Whanga Lagoon on 4 November 1959. Its engines, radar and radio were salvaged in 1960 and the rest of the wreck was repurposed by the population around the island. The last flight by RNZAF flying boats was on 22 March 1967. For many years Bristol Freighter aircraft served the islands, a slow and noisy freight aircraft converted for carrying passengers by installing a removable passenger compartment equipped with airline seats and a toilet in part of the cargo hold. The air service primarily served to ship out high-value export crayfish products.\nThe grass landing field at Hapupu, at the northern end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the ruggedness to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the landing field occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the rough landing. Hapupu is also the site of the Hāpūpū / J M Barker Historic Reserve (one of only two national historic reserves in New Zealand), where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).\nIn 1981, after many years of requests by locals and the imminent demise of the ageing Bristol Freighters, the construction of a sealed runway at Karewa, Tuuta Airport, allowed more modern aircraft to land safely. The Chathams' own airline, Air Chathams, with its head office in Te One, operates services to Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The timetable varies seasonally, but generally planes depart the Chathams around 09:30 am (Chathams Time) and arrive in the mainland around 11am and depart again at around 2 pm (NZ time) back to the Chathams. Air Chathams operates twin turboprop ATR 72–500 aircraft (freight and passenger) and dedicated freighter Saab 340 aircraft. The freighter is mainly used to supplement the ATR capacity during crayfish season for the transport of live export crayfish.\nThe ship Rangatira provided a freight service from Timaru to the Chatham Islands from March 2000 to August 2015. The MV Southern Tiare provides a freight service between Napier, Timaru and the Chathams.\n\n\nInternal transport\nBoats are used to transport people between the islands. In 1902 four people lost their lives when the whaling boat they were sailing on from Pitt Island to Ōwenga. On 17 July 1931, 11 people drowned when the 36 feet (11 m) long cutter-rigged launch Te Aroha sunk during a storm while sailing the 24 miles (39 km) from Kaingaroa to Ōwenga while transporting people to play in a football match. No bodies were ever found, only a severed hand. To date this has been the greatest single maritime loss of people on the islands. Lost were Bishop Ashton, Taaka Ngata, B. Remi, H. Stone, brothers Joseph and William Paynter, brothers Edward, Michael and Waiti Thompson, James Whaitirl and Ririmu Wiki. Up until the late 1960s boats were also regularly used to connect the settlements on the edges of the Te Whanga Lagoon.\nBy the 1920s a number of formal tracks had been created around the ports. After the end of the Second World War the Ministry of Works constructed a gravel road and bridges to Ōwenga. Tracks continued to be created but often did not conform with the \"paper roads\" on Smith's survey. Most islanders continued to travel by horses. To transport a number of people or freight, islanders would use a cart pulled by a single horse called a \"konake\" or \"Chatham islands truck\", which had a pair of wheels at the rear and sled-type runners at the front which assisted it in travelling over the soft soil covering the island. Another option was a \"jogger\" which was pulled by two horses and which used pneumatic tires. The tracks, or lack of them, were so bad that Norman Kirk (who was the local MP) on a visit to the islands in the late 1950s described a trip by Land Rover that took four hours to cover 31 miles. The Land Rover was accompanied by a tractor those task it was to pull the other vehicle out when it became bogged.\nUsing funds provided by the New Zealand government, a project was undertaken in 1969–70 to turn these tracks into formal roads to connect the airport at Hapapu, Kaingaroa, Manganui, Port Hutt, the Tuku and roads around Waitangi. The contract was awarded to Roger Mahon from Canterbury who shipped construction equipment to the islands. With the agreements of the islanders, he and the project engineer Brian Pease choose the best route, rather than follow the paper roads laid out in the 1870s and 1880s. The islanders assisted in the work by providing quarried rock and other hardfill at little or no cost to the project. Due to the benefits they were receiving from the improvement in access to their properties, landowners opted to receive no compensation for the value of the land taken for the roads. As a road was constructed, the surveyor Kenneth Wynne followed behind pegging out the legal road boundaries of what in many cases were wider roads and more roads than specified in the contract. \nThere is a small section of tar-sealed road between Waitangi and Te One, but the majority of the roads are gravel.\n\n\nTelecommunications\nA 1.5 kW wireless link opened in 1913, a public radio link to the mainland was built in 1953 and an island phone system in 1965. In 2003 a digital microwave system was installed for 110 phones in Ōwenga.\nThe islands were linked as part of the Rural Broadband Initiative in 2014, when satellite bandwidth was increased, and broadband is now provided by Wireless Nation, though Farmside provide some coverage.\nAs late as 2019 there was no mobile phone coverage on the islands. In December 2021, five 4G cellular towers were turned on to enable mobile phone coverage on Chatham and Pitt Island and deliver faster broadband. The main tower is positioned on Target Hill, which transmits to the other four towers through a microwave radio link; it is backhauled by Eutelsat 172B to a network in Wellington. The upgraded network delivers greater bandwidth than the previous link, and provides reliable broadband.\n\n\nEducation\n\nThere are three schools on the Chathams, at Kaingaroa, Te One, and Pitt Island.  Pitt Island and Kaingaroa Schools are staffed by sole charge principals, while Te One has three teachers and a principal. The schools cater for children from year 1 to 8.  There is no secondary school. The majority of secondary school-aged students leave the island for boarding schools in mainland New Zealand.  A small number remain on the island and obtain their secondary education by correspondence.  There is no tertiary or university level institution on the islands.  \n\n\nUnofficial flag\n\nThe unofficial flag of the Chatham Islands is a blue field with a map of the island in the centre, the Te Whanga Lagoon depicted in white. Behind this device map is a depiction of the rising sun, an allusion to its local name Rēkohu, meaning 'rising sun'. The flag was designed in 1989 by Logan Alderson, a former New Zealand police officer.\nAt the 2005 opening of a new marae on the islands (which included a rare visit by the Prime Minister), the Chathams flag was flown on a flagpole over the marae.\n\n\nNotable people\nRichard Charteris (b. 1948), New Zealand musicologist\nAbe Jacobs (1928–2023), New Zealand professional wrestler\nTe Kiato Riwai (1912–1967), New Zealand nurse and Māori welfare officer\nBrendon Tuuta (b. 1965), New Zealand international rugby league player\n\n\nSee also\n\n1924 Chatham Islands expedition\n1954 Chatham Islands expedition\nHistory of Chatham Islands numismatics\nList of historic places in the Chatham Islands\nList of islands of New Zealand\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nAnderson, Atholl (2014). \"Te ao tawhito: The old world\".

{"eco_id": 292, "eco_name": "Chhota-Nagpur dry deciduous forests", "wiki_title": "Chota Nagpur Plateau", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chota_Nagpur_Plateau", "extract_text": "The Chota Nagpur Plateau (IPA: [t͡ʃʰoːʈaː naːɡpʊɾ]) is a plateau in eastern India, which covers much of Jharkhand state as well as adjacent parts of Chhattisgarh,  Odisha, West Bengal and Bihar. The Indo-Gangetic Plain lies to the north and east of the plateau, and the basin of the Mahanadi River lies to the south. The total area of the Chota Nagpur Plateau is approximately 65,000 square kilometres (25,000 sq mi).\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Nagpur is probably taken from Nagavanshis, who ruled in this part of the country.  Chhota (small in Hindi) is the misunderstood name of \"Chutia\" village in the outskirts of Ranchi, which has the remains of an old fort belonging to the Nagavanshis.\n\n\nGeology\n\n\nFormation\n\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land.The plateau is composed of Precambrian rocks (i.e., rocks more than about 540 million years old). The plateau has been formed during the Cenozoic  by continental uplift due to tectonic forces. The Gondwana substrates attest to the plateau's ancient origin. It is part of the Deccan Plate, which broke free from the southern continent during the Cretaceous to embark on a 50-million-year journey that was interrupted by the collision with the Eurasian continent. The northeastern part of the Deccan Plateau, where this ecoregion sits, was the first area of contact with Eurasia. The history of metamorphism, granitic activities and igneous intrusions in the Chotanagpur area continued for a period from over 1000 Ma to 185 Ma.\n\n\nFossil record\nThe Chota Nagpur region has a notable fossil presence. The fossil-rich sedimentary units host fossilized remains across a range of biota, such as angiosperm leaves, fruits, flowers, wood, and fish. This stratigraphy has been associated with the Neogene, specifically the Pliocene epoch, despite a lack of conclusive evidence. Earlier studies identified vertebrate fossils in these sediments, with reported fish fossils with affinities to modern families, linking these deposits to recent ichthyofauna adaptations.\n\n\nDivisions\n\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau consists of three steps. The highest step is in the western part of the plateau, where pats as a plateau is locally called, are 910 to 1,070 metres (3,000 to 3,500 ft) above sea level. The highest point is 1,164 metres (3,819 ft). The next part contains larger portions of the old Ranchi and Hazaribagh districts and some parts of old Palamu district, before these were broken up into smaller administrative units. The general height is 610 metres (2,000 ft). The topography in undulating with prominent gneissic hills, often dome-like in outline. The lowest step of the plateau is at an average level of around 300 metres (1,000 ft). It covers the old Manbhum and Singhbhum districts. High hills are a striking part of this section – Parasnath Hills rise to a height of 1,370 metres (4,480 ft) and Dalma Hills to 1,038 metres (3,407 ft). The large plateau is subdivided into several small plateaus or sub-plateaus.\n\n\nPat region\nThe western plateau with an average elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) above mean sea level merges into the plateau of the Surguja district of Chhattisgarh. The flat topped plateau, locally known as pats are characterized by level surface and accordance of their summit levels shows they are part of one large plateau. Examples include Netarhat Pat, Jamira Pat, Khamar Pat, Rudni Pat and others. The area is also referred to as Western Ranchi Plateau. It is believed to be composed of Deccan basalt lava.\n\n\nRanchi Plateau\n\nThe Ranchi Plateau is the largest part of the Chota Nagpur Plateau. The elevation of the plateau surface in this part is about 700 m (2,300 ft) and gradually slopes down towards south-east into the hilly and undulating region of Singhbhum (earlier the Singhbhum district or what is now the Kolhan division). The plateau is highly dissected. The Damodar River originates here and flows through a rift valley. To the north it is separated from the Hazaribagh plateau by the Damodar trough. To  the west is a group of plateaus called pat.\nThere are many waterfalls at the edges of the Ranchi plateau where rivers coming from over the plateau surface form waterfalls when they descend through the precipitous escarpments of the plateau and enter the area of significantly lower elevation. The North Karo River has formed the 17 m (56 ft) high Pheruaghaugh Falls at the southern margin of the Ranchi plateau. Such falls are called scarp falls. Hundru Falls (75 m) on the Subarnarekha River near Ranchi, Dassam Falls (39.62 m) on the Kanchi River, east of Ranchi, Sadni Falls (60 m) on the Sankh River (Ranchi plateau) are examples of scarp falls. Sometimes waterfalls of various dimensions are formed when tributary streams join the master stream from great heights forming hanging valleys. At Rajrappa (10 m), the Bhera River coming over from the Ranchi Plateau hangs above the Damodar River at its point of confluence with the latter. The Jonha Falls (25.9 m) is another example of this category of falls. The Ganga River hangs over its master stream, the Raru River (to the east of Ranchi city) and forms the said falls.\n\n\nHazaribagh Plateau\nThe Hazaribagh plateau is often subdivided into two parts – the higher plateau and the lower plateau. Here the higher plateau is referred to as Hazaribagh plateau and the lower plateau as Koderma plateau. The Hazaribagh plateau on which Hazaribagh town is built is about 64 km (40 mi) east by west and 24 km (15 mi) north by south with an average elevation of 610 m (2,000 ft). The north-eastern and southern faces are mostly abrupt; but to the west it narrows and descends slowly in the neighbourhood of Simaria and Jabra where it curves to the south and connects with the Ranchi Plateau through Tori pargana. It is generally separated from the Ranchi plateau by the Damodar trough.\nThe western portion of Hazaribagh plateau constitutes a broad watershed between the Damodar drainage on the south and the Lilajan and Mohana rivers on the north. The highest hills in this area are called after the villages of Kasiatu, Hesatu and Hudu, and rise fronting the south 180 m (600 ft) above the general level of the plateau. Further east along the southern face a long spur projects right up to the Damodar river where it ends in Aswa Pahar, elevation 751 metres (2,465 ft). At the south-eastern corner of the plateau is Jilinga Hill at 932 metres (3,057 ft). Mahabar Jarimo at 666 m (2,185 ft) and Barsot at 660 m (2,180 ft) stand in isolation to the east, and on the north-west edge of the plateau Sendraili at 670 m (2,210 ft) and Mahuda at 734 m (2,409 ft) are the most prominent features. Isolated on the plateau, in the neighbourhood of Hazaribagh town are four hills of which the highest Chendwar rises to 860 m (2,810 ft). On all sides it has an exceedingly abrupt scarp, modified only on the south-east. In the south it falls almost sheer in a swoop of 670 m (2,200 ft) to the bed of Bokaro River, below Jilinga Hill. Seen from the north the edge of this plateau has the appearance of a range of hills, at the foot of which (on the Koderma plateau) runs the Grand Trunk Road and NH 2 (new NH19).\n\n\nKoderma Plateau\nThe Koderma plateau is also referred to as the Hazaribagh lower plateau or as the Chauparan-Koderma-Girighi sub-plateau.\nThe northern face of the Koderma plateau, elevated above the plains of Bihar, has the appearance of a range of hills, but in reality it is the edge of a plateau, 240 metres (800 ft) from the level of the Gaya plain. Eastward this northern edge forms a well-defined watershed between heads of the tributaries of Gaya and those of the Barakar River, which traverses the Koderma and Giridih districts in an easterly direction. The slope of this plateau to the east is uniform and gentle and is continued past the river, which bears to the south-east, into the Santhal Parganas and gradually disappears in the lower plains of Bengal. The western boundary of the plateau is formed by the deep bed of the Lilajan River.The southern boundary consists of the face of the higher plateau, as far as its eastern extremity, where for some distance a low and undistinguished watershed runs eastward to the western spurs of Parasnath Hills. The drainage to the south of this low line passes by the Jamunia River to the Damodar.\n\n\nDamodar trough\nThe Damodar basin forms a trough between the Ranchi and Hazaribagh plateaus resulting from enormous fractures at their present edges, which caused the land between to sink to a great depth and incidentally preserved from denudation by the Karanpura, Ramgarh and Bokaro coalfields. The northern boundary of the Damodar valley is steep as far as the southeastern corner of the Hazaribagh plateau. On the south of the trough the Damodar keeps close to the edge of the Ranchi plateau till it has passed Ramgarh, after which a turn to the north-east leaves on the right hand a wide and level valley on which the Subarnarekha begins to intrude, south of Gola till the Singhpur Hills divert it to the south. Further to the east the Damodar River passes tamely into the Manbhum sector of lowest step of the Chota Nagpur plateau.\n\n\nPalamu\nThe Palamu division generally lies at a lower height than the surrounding areas of Chota Nagpur Plateau. On the east the Ranchi plateau intrudes into the division and the southern part of the division merges with the Pat region. On the west are the Surguja highlands of Chhattishgarh and Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh. The Son River touches the north-western corner of the division and then forms the state boundary for about 72 kilometres (45 mi). The general system of the area is a series of parallel ranges of hills running east and west through which the North Koel River passes. The hills in the south are the highest in the area, and the picturesque and isolated cup-like Chhechhari valley is surrounded by lofty hills on every side. Lodh Falls drops from a height of 150 metres (490 ft) from these hills, making it the highest waterfall on the Chota Nagpur Plateau. Netarhat and Pakripat plateaus are physiographically part of the Pat region.\n\n\nManbhum-Singhbhum\n\nIn the lowest step of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, the Manbhum area covers the present Purulia district in West Bengal, and Dhanbad district and parts of Bokaro district in Jharkhand, and the Singhbhum area broadly covers Kolhan division of Jharkhand. The Manbhum area has a general elevation of about 300 metres (1,000 ft) and it consists of undulating land with scattered hills – Baghmundi and Ajodhya range, Panchakot and the hills around Jhalda are the prominent ones. Adjacent Bankura district of West Bengal has been described as the \"connecting link between the plains of Bengal on the east and Chota Nagpur plateau on the west.\" The same could be said of the Birbhum district and the Asansol and Durgapur subdivisions of Paschim Bardhaman district.\nThe Singhbhum area contains much more hilly and broken country. The whole of the western part is a mass of hill ranges rising to 910 metres (3,000 ft) in the south-west. Jamshedpur sits on an open plateau, 120 to 240 metres (400 to 800 ft) above mean sea level, with a higher plateau to the south of it. The eastern part is mostly hilly, though near the borders of West Bengal it flattens out into an alluvial plain. In the Singhbhum area, there are hills alternating with valleys, steep mountains, deep forests on the mountain slopes, and, in the river basins, some stretches of comparatively level or undulating country. The centre of the area consists of an upland plateau enclosed by hill ranges. This strip, extending from the Subarnarekha River on the east to the Angarbira range to the west of Chaibasa, is a very fertile area.  Saranda forest is reputed to have the best Sal forests in Asia.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau has an attractive climate. For five to six months of the year, from October onward the days are sunny and bracing. The mean temperature in December is 23 °C (73 °F). The nights are cool and temperatures in winter may drop below freezing point in many places. In April and May the day temperature may cross 38 °C (100 °F) but it is very dry and not sultry as in the adjacent plains. The rainy season (June to September) is pleasant. The Chota Nagpur Plateau receives an annual average rainfall of around 1,400 millimetres (55 in), which is less than the rainforested areas of much of India and almost all of it in the monsoon months between June and August.\n\n\nEcology\n\nThe Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests, a tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests ecoregion, encompasses the plateau. The ecoregion has an area of 122,100 square kilometres (47,100 mi2), covering most of the state of Jharkhand and adjacent portions of Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.\nThe ecoregion is drier than surrounding ones, including the Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests that covers the Eastern Ghats and Satpura Range to the south, and the Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests in the lowlands to the east and north.\nThe plateau is covered with a variety of various habitats of which Sal forest is predominant. The plateau is home to the Palamau Tiger Reserve and other large blocks of natural habitat which are among the few remaining refuges left in India for large populations of tiger and Asian elephants.\n\n\nFlora\nThe flora of the Chota Nagpur Plateau ranges from dry to wet forests, with trees reaching heights of up to 25 metres (82 ft). Some areas are swampy, while others feature bamboo grasslands and shrubs like Holarrhena and Dodonaea.\nKey species include sal (Shorea robusta), which provides valuable timber and supports diverse wildlife, and mahua (Madhuca longifolia), known for its fragrant flowers used to make a traditional alcoholic beverage and as a food source for animals. Other significant plants include bamboo (Bambusa), teak (Tectona grandis), and wild mango (Mangifera indica), flame of the forest (Butea monosperma).\n\n\nFauna\n\nThe region is home to diverse wildlife, including apex predators like the tiger (Panthera tigris) and large herbivores such as the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Ungulates such as the four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), and chinkara (Gazella bennettii) are also common, alongside predators like the dhole (Cuon alpinus) and the sloth bear (Melursus ursinus). Bird species include the threatened lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus), various hornbills including the Indian grey hornbill (Ocyceros birostris), and a variety of raptors and migratory birds.\n\n\nConservation\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau was once extensively forested, but today over half of its natural forest cover has been removed, largely for grazing land and increasingly intense mining activities. These disruptions pose significant ecological threats. Mining for minerals like coal, iron ore, and bauxite has led to large-scale deforestation, soil erosion, and habitat fragmentation, which critically affects the survival and movement of native wildlife, particularly larger species such as elephants, tigers, and leopards that require extensive, undisturbed areas.\nSome conservation efforts are underway, including the establishment of protected areas and wildlife corridors aimed at reconnecting fragmented habitats. However, challenges remain due to limited enforcement of conservation policies and the economic dependence of local communities on mining and agriculture, which places continual pressure on the plateau's ecological resources.\n\n\nProtected areas\nAbout 6 percent of the ecoregion's area is within protected areas, comprising 6,720 square kilometres (2,590 mi2) in 1997. The largest are Palamau Tiger Reserve and Guru Ghasidas - Tamor Pingla Tiger Reserve.\n\nDalma Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (630 km2)\nGautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary, Bihar (110 km2)\nHazaribag Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (450 km2)\nKoderma Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (180 km2)\nLawalong Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (410 km2)\nPalamau Tiger Reserve, Jharkhand (1,330 km2)\nPalkot Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (182.83 km2 )\nSemarsot Wildlife Sanctuary, Chhattisgarh (470 km2)\nTamor Pingla Wildlife Sanctuary, Chhattisgarh (600 km2)\nTopchanchi Wildlife Sanctuary, Jharkhand (40 km2)\n\n\nCulture\n\nThe Chota Nagpur region is a culturally rich area with a diverse population comprising various indigenous ethinic group of Sadan and tribes. The region is home to tribes like the Santhal, Munda, Oraon, and Ho, alongside non-tribal groups. These groups have distinct traditions, languages, and spiritual practices, often tied closely to nature and ancestral worship. Festivals like Sarhul, Holi and Karam are central to their culture, celebrating harvests and nature with traditional music, dance, and rituals. Craftsmanship is a strong aspect, with communities creating intricate beadwork, pottery, and metalwork. \n\nHuman habitation in the region dates back to the Mesolithic-Chalcolithic period, as evidenced by various ancient cave paintings. Stone tools from the Chota Nagpur Plateau indicate human activity dating back to the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. Additionally, ancient cave paintings at Isko in Hazaribagh district date to the Meso-Chalcolithic period (9000–5000 BCE). Large-scale extraction industries in coal and iron mining dominate the economy, alongside growing steel production, power generation, and related infrastructure developments. However, agriculture remains important, with rice, maize, and pulses as staple crops.\n\n\nMineral resources\n\nChota Nagpur plateau is a store house of mineral resources such as mica, bauxite, copper, limestone, iron ore and coal. The Damodar valley is rich in coal, and it is considered as the prime centre of coking coal in the country. Massive coal deposits are found in the central basin spreading over 2,883 square kilometres (1,113 mi2). The important coalfields in the basin are Jharia, Raniganj, West Bokaro, East Bokaro, Ramgarh, South Karanpura and North Karanpura.\n\n\nSee also\nChota Nagpur Division\nEcoregions of India\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nGupta, Satya Prakash.

{"eco_id": 69, "eco_name": "East African halophytics", "wiki_title": "Lake Natron", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Natron", "extract_text": "Lake Natron is a highly alkaline salt lake located in north Ngorongoro District of Arusha Region in Tanzania with its far northern end crossing into Kajiado County and Narok County in Kenya. It is in the Gregory Rift, which is the eastern branch of the East African Rift. The lake is within the Lake Natron Basin, a Ramsar Site wetland of international significance.\n\n\nDescription\nThis lake is fed principally by the Southern Ewaso Ng'iro River, which rises in central Kenya, and by mineral-rich hot springs. It is quite shallow, less than three metres (9.8 ft) deep, and varies in width depending on its water level. The lake is a maximum of 57 kilometres (35 mi) long and 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide. The surrounding area receives irregular seasonal rainfall, mainly between December and May totalling 800 millimetres (31 in) per year. Temperatures at the lake are frequently above 40 °C (104 °F).\nHigh levels of evaporation have left behind natron (sodium carbonate decahydrate) and trona (sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate). The alkalinity of the lake can reach a pH of greater than 12. The surrounding bedrock is composed of alkaline, sodium-dominated trachyte lavas that were laid down during the Pleistocene period. The lavas have significant amounts of carbonate but very low calcium and magnesium levels. This has allowed the lake to concentrate into a caustic alkaline brine.\nThe chemical properties of the water are known to calcify the bodies of any living thing that died in the lake.\n\n\nFlora\nThe colour of the lake is characteristic of those where very high evaporation rates occur. As water evaporates during the dry season, salinity levels increase to the point that salt-loving microorganisms begin to thrive. Such halophile organisms include some cyanobacteria that make their own food with photosynthesis as plants do. The red accessory photosynthesizing pigment in the cyanobacteria produces the deep reds of the open water of the lake and the orange colours of the shallow parts of the lake. The alkali salt crust on the surface of the lake is also often coloured red or pink by the halophilic microorganisms that live there.\nSalt marshes and freshwater wetlands around the edges of the lake do support a variety of plants.\n\n\nFauna\nMost animals find the lake's high temperature (up to 60 °C [140 °F]) and its high and variable salt content inhospitable. Nonetheless, Lake Natron is home to some endemic algae, invertebrates, and birds. In the slightly less salty water around its margins, some fish can also survive.\nThe lake is the only regular breeding area in East Africa for the 2.5 million lesser flamingoes, whose status of \"near threatened\" results from their dependence on this one location. When salinity increases, so do cyanobacteria, and the lake can also support more nests. These flamingoes, the single large flock in East Africa, gather along nearby saline lakes to feed on Spirulina (a blue-green algae with red pigments). Lake Natron is a safe breeding location because its caustic environment is a barrier against predators trying to reach their nests on seasonally forming evaporite islands. Greater flamingoes also breed on the mud flats.\nThe lake has inspired the nature documentary The Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos by Disneynature, for its close relationship with the Lesser flamingoes as their only regular breeding area.\nTwo endemic fish species, the alkaline tilapias Alcolapia latilabris and A. ndalalani, also thrive in the waters at the edges of the hot spring inlets. A. alcalica is also present in the lake, but is not endemic.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nThe area around the salt lake is not inhabited but there is some herding and some seasonal cultivation. Threats to the salinity balance from increased siltation influxes will come from more projected logging in Natron watersheds and a planned hydroelectric power plant on the  Ewaso Ng'iro across the border in Kenya. Although development plans include constructions of a dike at the north end of the lake to contain the freshwater, the threat of dilution to this breeding ground may still be serious. There is no formal protection.\nA new threat to Lake Natron is the proposed development of a soda ash plant on its shores. The plant would pump water from the lake and extract the sodium carbonate to convert to washing powder for export. Accompanying the plant would be housing for over 1000 workers, and a coal-fired power station to provide energy for the plant complex. In addition, there is a possibility the developers may introduce a hybrid brine shrimp to increase the efficiency of extraction.\nAccording to Chris Magin, the RSPB's international officer for Africa, \"The chance of the lesser flamingoes continuing to breed in the face of such mayhem are next to zero. This development will leave lesser flamingoes in East Africa facing extinction\". Seventy-five percent of the world's lesser flamingoes are born on Lake Natron. Currently a group of more than fifty East African conservation and environmental institutions are running a worldwide campaign to stop the planned construction of the soda ash factory by Tata Chemicals Ltd of Mumbai, India, and National Development Corporation of Tanzania. The group working under the umbrella name Lake Natron Consultative Group is being co-ordinated by Ken Mwathe, Conservation Programme Manager at BirdLife International's Africa Secretariat.\nAs per communication in June 2008, Tata Chemicals shall not proceed with the Natron Project and further re-examination of this project will be subject to the Ramsar Wetlands plan, which is currently under preparation.\nBecause of its unique biodiversity, Tanzania named the Lake Natron Basin to the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance on 4 July 2001. The lake is also the World Wildlife Fund East African halophytics ecoregion.\n\n\nVisiting the area\nThere are a number of campgrounds near the lake, which is also the base for climbing Ol Doinyo Lengai. Lake Natron has tourist attraction potentials that are important for ecotourism development. However, lack of a general management plan, inadequate funding at the operational level, lack of mechanisms to secure a fair distribution of ecotourism benefits, and poorly developed tourism infrastructural facilities to support diverse segments of tourists were identified as the main challenges associated with the management of ecotourism in the area. The lake can also be accessed from Shompole Conservancy Kenya.\n\n\nSee also\nRift Valley lakes\nThe Crimson Wing: Mystery of the Flamingos\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nLakeNet Profile\nThink Pink – Save Africa's Flamingos\nNBC article about Nick Brandt's photos of petrified animals at Natron lake\n\"Lake Natron, Tanzania\".

{"eco_id": 191, "eco_name": "Eastern Australia mulga shrublands", "wiki_title": "Mulga Lands", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulga_Lands", "extract_text": "The Mulga Lands are an interim Australian bioregion of eastern Australia consisting of dry sandy plains with low mulga woodlands and shrublands that are dominated by Acacia aneura (mulga). The Eastern Australia mulga shrublands ecoregion is coterminous with the Mulga Lands bioregion.\n\n\nLocation and description\n\nLocated in inland New South Wales and Queensland, these are flat plains with some low hills and infertile sandy soil with a cover of grasses and shrubs with mulga and eucalyptus trees. The region contains areas of wetland, most of them only seasonally flooded, these include Lake Wyara and Lake Numalla, the Currawinya Lakes, Lake Bindegolly and others on the Warrego and the Paroo Rivers, the latter of which in particular remains relatively unmanaged and in its natural state.\nThe area has a very dry climate, with unpredictable low rainfall (450–650 mm per year). The plains are drained in three directions: the eastern side by the Wallam, Nebine and Mungallala Creeks (tributaries of the Culgoa River), and the Warrego and Paroo rivers into the Murray-Darling basin; the southwest by the Bulloo River into wetlands near the Simpson Desert; and finally the northern side by the Barcoo River towards Lake Eyre. The Great Artesian Basin lies below these plains and more rich patches of wildlife are found around mound springs stemming from the basin.\nThe Mulga Lands are defined by their plant life and poor soil and as such are distinct from neighbouring ecoregions, the Brigalow Belt to the east and the Mitchell Grass Downs to the north, both of which have better soil and richer plant life. The Southeast Australia temperate savanna ecoregion lies to the south and southeast. The drier Simpson Desert and Tirari-Sturt stony desert ecoregions lie to the west.\nThe mulga lands are sparsely populated and mostly used for grazing sheep and cattle.\n\n\nFlora\n\nMulga trees are a type of acacia which have adapted to efficiently collect the sparse rainfall, are the distinctive habitat of this ecoregion while the ground cover consists of shrubs and grasses. However the mulga lands are not uniform and there are micro-climates and patches of other kinds of habitat, especially areas of eucalyptus woodland in the better-watered parts that have more wildlife than the mulga acacia plains themselves. Eucalyptus trees found here include bimble box, coolibah, and silver-leaved ironbark. To the east of the Warrego River in Queensland the mulga lands merge into a heath of sand dunes. Throughout the mulga lands plant life quickly flourishes after rainfall and habitats revive and change.\n\n\nFauna\n\nCurrawinya National Park is part of the project to revive Australia's population of the bilby, which in the park is protected from dingos and cats. This part of Australia is generally dry and when flooded Lakes Wyara and Numalla are important habitats for birds, being home to 250,000 birds of 40 species including the rainbow bee-eater, Australasian shoveller, freckled duck, musk duck, black swan, silver gull, Australian pelican, great egret, and glossy ibis.\n\n\nConservation and threats\nTogether with the Brigalow Belt, the Mulga Lands are where most of Queensland's land clearing is occurring. 80% of the original plant cover is intact, especially in the drier inland west, as some areas of eucalyptus woodland have been cleared in the eastern side of the area. There are no endangered habitats in the mulga lands. However, most of the area is used for grazing sheep and cattle, so there is always a danger of overgrazing while mulga leaves are used as livestock fodder and other trees are removed to create more grassland and to allow access to water sources. The mound springs are particularly affected by this. There are some areas of National Park, the largest of which is Currawinya, whose wetlands are especially important as bird habitats. Others include Hell Hole Gorge, Lake Bindegolly, Mariala, Thrushton, part of Welford, Idalia and the Culgoa Floodplain National Parks.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Mulga Lands at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1331836720, "rev_timestamp": "2026-01-08T13:15:54Z", "source": "enwiki"}
{"eco_id": 333, "eco_name": "Eastern Canadian Forest-Boreal transition", "wiki_title": "Eastern forest–boreal transition", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_forest%E2%80%93boreal_transition", "extract_text": "The eastern forest–boreal transition is a temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion of North America, mostly in eastern Canada.  It is a transitional zone or region between the predominantly coniferous Boreal Forest and the mostly deciduous broadleaf forest region further south.\n\n\nLocation and climate\nThe ecoregion includes most of the southern Canadian Shield in Ontario and Quebec north and west of the Saint Lawrence River lowlands. The portion in Northeastern Ontario includes the eastern shores of Lake Superior, Greater Sudbury, North Bay, Ontario, Lake Nipissing, the Clay Belt and Temagami. Areas in Central Ontario include Muskoka, Parry Sound, Algonquin Park, and Haliburton.  The Quebec portion takes in Lake Timiskaming, the southern Laurentian Mountains, Quebec City, the Saguenay River, and Saguenay, Quebec. There is a separate section of the ecoregion in the Adirondack Mountains in upper New York State, United States. However the higher elevations of the Laurentian Mountains and the northern Appalachian Mountains in Canada constitute the Eastern Canadian forests ecoregion.\nThe region has a humid continental climate (Dfb) consisting of warm summers and cold, snowy winters, and is warmer towards the south.\n\n\nFlora\nThe flora in this ecoregion varies considerably based on soil conditions and elevation. These mixed forests are distinct from the deciduous forests south of the Canadian Shield and the cooler boreal forests to the north.\n\n\nConifer swamp\nConifer swamps occur in areas of seasonal flooding. Trees can be very dense or sparse; mats of sphagnum moss cover the ground. Black spruce (Picea mariana) and tamarack (Larix laricina) are the predominant tree species. Where the soil is not saturated year round grows northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). Speckled alder (Alnus incana) grows around the edges of these swamps and red spruce (Picea rubens) and white pine (Pinus strobus) grow on higher, drier ground.\n\n\nLowland conifer forests\nLowland conifer forests occur on flats, low ridges, and knolls near bodies of water. They are dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and red spruce (Picea rubens), although white pine (Pinus strobus), red pine (Pinus resinosa) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) also occur. The ground is often stony with little vegetation.\n\n\nHardwood–conifer mixed forests\nHardwood–conifer mixed forests occur in a transition zone between lowland conifer and northern hardwood forests. The ground is less rocky than in the lowland conifer forests and thus supports more vegetation. Trees include red spruce, balsam fir, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), red maple (Acer rubrum), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). The understory vegetation is abundant, with witch hobble (Viburnum lantanoides), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), and striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum). The herbaceous layer include common wood sorrel (Oxalis spp.), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), yellow clintonia (Clintonia borealis), ferns, and mosses.\n\n\nNorthern hardwood forests\nNorthern hardwood forests occur on the richest, most productive soils. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and yellow birch are the predominant tree species. In secondary forests, red spruce, white pine, white ash (Fraxinus americana), eastern hemlock, black cherry (Prunus serotina), and red maple are present. Witch hobble (Viburnum lantanoides) is a common understory shrub. Ferns and clubmosses grow in the herbaceous layer, along with numerous species of spring-flowering forbs.\n\n\nUpper slope hardwood–conifer mixed forests\nUpper slope hardwood–conifer mixed forests are an area of transition between the northern hardwood and the mountain conifer forests. They are similar to hardwood–conifer forests, but with no red maple. Red spruce and eastern hemlock, together with sugar maple, yellow birch, and American beech are the dominant species, with scattered white pine.\n\n\nMountain conifer forests\nRed spruce and balsam fir are common at lower elevations of the mountain conifer forests. Hardwoods that grow among the conifers include paper birch, yellow birch, and American mountain-ash (Sorbus americana). With increasing elevation, balsam fir becomes more abundant. Near treeline, black spruce joins balsam fir in the krummholz. Herbaceous plants include wood sorrel, bunchberry, yellow clintonia, and spinulose woodfern (Dryopteris carthusiana). Mosses and lichens cover exposed rocks.\n\n\nAlpine\nRocks are exposed and covered with lichens and mosses. Low-lying plants more common in the tundra to the north grow here. They include gold-colored deer's hair (Trichophorum cespitosum), alpine bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), lapland rosebay (Rhododendron lapponicum), bearberry willow (Salix uva-ursi), mountain sandwort (Minuartia groenlandica), and alpine holy grass (Hierochloe alpina). In the Adirondacks, these communities are limited to 85 acres (34 ha) on 11 peaks.\n\n\nFauna\nOld-growth forest such as the pinewoods found in this ecoregion are home to a complex variety of long-established wildlife including many invertebrates and reptiles and birds such as American black duck (Anas rubripes), wood duck (Aix sponsa), hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus), and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus).\nMammals found here include the moose (Alces alces), American black bear (Ursus americanus), Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), coyote (Canis latrans), North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Extirpated mammals include the boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), eastern elk (Cervus canadensis canadensis), wolverine (Gulo gulo) and eastern cougar (Puma concolor couguar).\nThe Lake Nipissing area in particular is home to eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina).\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nThese forests have been severely damaged by centuries of clearance for timber, roads, agricultural and urban development. This development now includes ski facilities, while logging and mining are ongoing. Protected areas include: Papineau-Labelle Wildlife Reserve, Mont-Tremblant, Jacques-Cartier, Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivière-Malbaie and La Mauricie National Parks in Quebec; Algonquin Provincial Park, Lake Superior Provincial Park, Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, French River Provincial Park, Killarney Provincial Park, Daisy Lake Uplands Provincial Park, and a number of parks in Algoma District in Ontario; and Adirondack Park in New York. Adirondack Park contains the largest areas of original red pine and eastern white pine in the world and one of the largest areas of original forest in the United States, the Five Ponds Wilderness Area.\n\n\nSee also\nList of ecoregions in Canada (WWF)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\"Eastern Forest-Boreal Transition\".

It corresponds to the Einasleigh Uplands savanna ecoregion, as identified by the World Wildlife Fund.\n\n\nLocation and description\nThis area is inland from the moist Queensland coast but is not as dry as the Brigalow Belt and the Mitchell Grass Downs savannas to the south, while the Cape York Peninsula to the north is lower-lying and wetter. The region contains a number of specialised habitats that add to the variety of wildlife found here. These include lava tubes and caves such as those of Chillagoe.\nThe uplands are an area of eroded volcanic rock on and to the west of the Atherton Tableland in the northern section of Australia's Great Dividing Range running inland as far as the town of Croydon in the southwest. The plateau is covered in grassland dotted with eucalyptus trees and cut through with ridges, gorges and lava tubes. The area has rich fertile soil. Natural features include the Great Basalt Wall of dried volcanic lava and the lava tubes of Undara Volcanic National Park.\nRivers that have their source in the uplands include the Flinders River which runs northwest to the Gulf of Carpentaria along with the Palmer, Mitchell and Gilbert-Einasleigh while the Burdekin and Herbert Rivers run south-east from the tablelands to the Coral Sea coast.\nUrban areas include Herberton and Croydon.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is cooler than the coast with summer nights being as cool as 9 °C compared with 20 °C on the coast. The summer high temperatures are around 35 °C. There is a wet season between December and March.\n\n\nFlora\nThis stony upland habitat is dominated by ironbark eucalyptus woodland but there are wetlands and patches of rainforest too. Lava flows are home to stands of thicker forest.\n\n\nFauna\nThese woodlands are home to many animals including a number of marsupials such as the antilopine kangaroo, the large eastern grey kangaroo and the near-endemic Godman's rock-wallaby and Mareeba rock-wallaby. There are a number of endemic mammals, reptiles and insects in the region especially in the more thickly forested areas where a large number of endemic reptiles occur. The caves and lava flows harbour specific wildlife of their own as do the wetter east-facing slopes of the uplands. Rivers such as the Burdekin have important populations of waterbirds as do the unique (to Australia) wetlands of Innot Hot Springs.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nThe area has long been used for cattle ranching but apart from the heavily farmed Atherton Tableland is thinly populated so the landscape is well preserved although it has been changed by overgrazing, clearance for agriculture and the introduction of weeds. Some areas of the acacia gidgee (Acacia cambagei) in the southeast of the uplands have suffered in particular. There are a number of protected areas containing a good variety of the different types of habitat found in the region, including Undara and the Great Basalt Wall as well as Blackbraes National Park, Kinrara National Park, Littleton National Park, part of Bulleringa National Park and the caves of Chillagoe.\n\n\nSee also\n\nGeography of Australia\nInterim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Einasleigh Upland Savanna Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1328186464, "rev_timestamp": "2025-12-18T10:51:24Z", "source": "enwiki"}

It extends between 103°24'W and 79°45'W. The area west of 90°W is unclaimed, the area between 84°W and 90°W is claimed by Chile only, and the remainder by Chile and the United Kingdom as a part of the British Antarctic Territory. Eights Coast stretches between 103°24'W and 89°35'W, and Bryan Coast between 89°35'W and 79°45'W.\nIt is largely a high ice plateau, but includes the Ellsworth Mountains and a number of scattered mountain groups: Hudson, Jones, Behrendt, Hauberg, Merrick, Sweeney and Scaife Mountains.\nThis land lies near the center of the area traversed by American explorer Lincoln Ellsworth on an airplane flight during November–December 1935. It was named for him by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names in 1962 to commemorate that historic transcontinental flight from Dundee Island to the Ross Ice Shelf.\nInformation regarding the biodiversity of Ellsworth Land is comparatively limited due to the fewer research surveys and visitations in the region. Forty species of lichen and five of moss have been identified, with Usnea sphacelata being amongst the most prominent species in the region.

However this is good soil for farming and the woodland has mostly been cleared for agriculture now. This coast has a temperate climate with a wet winter (300mm to 600mm of rainfall per year).\n\n\nSubregions\nThe IBRA identifies five subregions of the bioregion:\n\nSouthern Yorke – 438,470 hectares (1,083,500 acres)\nSt Vincent – 1,093,789 hectares (2,702,810 acres)\nEyre Hills – 1,172,576 hectares (2,897,500 acres)\nTalia – 1,096,175 hectares (2,708,710 acres)\nEyre Mallee – 2,319,398 hectares (5,731,360 acres)\n\n\nFlora\nThe original vegetation of these low hills was woodland of short trees with a shrubby undergrowth. The original woodland consisted mainly of a tea tree Melaleuca lanceolata and mallee box (Eucalyptus porosa), a mallee eucalyptus. The flora of the two peninsulas does differ, with the Eyre Peninsula flora having similarities with areas further west as well as number of endemic species, while the Yorke Peninsula has plants typical of areas to the east. \n\n\nFauna\nMammals of the region include the western grey kangaroo and the southern hairy-nosed wombat, although many more (such as the tammar wallaby have become extinct on the two peninsulas since they have been cleared for farmland. Birds include the emu.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nMost of the area has been cleared for farmland resulting in reduced populations and local extinction of much wildlife, especially on Yorke Peninsula. However clearance has mostly ceased now and the northern areas of Eyre Peninsula in particular still have large areas of mallee woodland while the coastal dunes remain mostly unspoilt also. Weeds, fertiliser and herbicide runoff are still threatening habitats.

Only the eponymous main island is inhabited; it has an area of 18.4 km2 (7.1 sq mi) and a population estimated at 3,101 in 2020. While most of the archipelago is relatively low-lying, there are parts reaching more than 100 m (328 ft) in elevation.\nThe islands are administratively unique in Brazil. They form a \"state district\" (distrito estadual) that is administered directly by the government of the state of Pernambuco (despite being geographically closer to the state of Rio Grande do Norte). The state district's jurisdiction also includes the very remote Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, located 625 km (337 nmi; 388 mi) northeast of Fernando de Noronha.\nIn 1988, 70% of the area of Fernando de Noronha was established as a national marine park. In 2001, UNESCO designated the islands as a World Heritage Site because of their importance as a feeding ground for tuna, sharks, sea turtles, and marine mammals. Its time zone is UTC−02:00 all year round.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nDiscovery\n\nFernando de Noronha's occupation dates to the early 16th century. Due to its geographical position, the archipelago was one of the first lands sighted in the New World, being shown in a nautical chart in 1500 by the Spanish cartographer Juan de La Cosa, and in 1502 by the Portuguese Alberto Cantino, in the latter with the name \"Quaresma\".\nBased on the written record, Fernando de Noronha island was discovered on August 10, 1503, by a Portuguese expedition, organized and financed by a private commercial consortium headed by the Lisbon merchant Fernão de Loronha.  The expedition was under the overall command of captain Gonçalo Coelho and carried the Italian adventurer Amerigo Vespucci, who wrote an account of it. The flagship of the expedition hit a reef and foundered near the island. On Coelho's orders, Vespucci anchored at the island, and spent a week there, while the rest of the Coelho fleet went on south.  In his letter to Soderini, Vespucci describes the uninhabited island and reports its name as the \"island of St. Lawrence\" (August 10 is the feast day of St. Lawrence; it was a custom of Portuguese explorations to name locations by the liturgical calendar).\nThe island's existence was reported to Lisbon sometime between then and January 16, 1504, when King Manuel I of Portugal issued a charter granting the \"island of St. John\" (São João) as a hereditary captaincy to Fernão de Loronha. As Vespucci did not return to Lisbon until June 1504, historians have hypothesized that a stray ship of the Coelho fleet, under an unknown captain, may have returned to the island to collect Vespucci, did not find him or anyone else there, and went back to Lisbon by itself with the news. Vespucci, in his letter, claims that he left the island August 18, 1503, and upon his arrival in Lisbon a year later, on June 18, 1504, the people of Lisbon were surprised, as they \"had been told\" that his ship had been lost. The captain who returned to Lisbon with the news of the island and Vespucci's ship's loss is unknown. Some have speculated this captain was Loronha himself, the chief financier of this expedition.\nThis account, reconstructed from the written record, is challenged by the cartographic record. An island, named Quaresma, looking very much like Fernando de Noronha island, appears in the Cantino planisphere. The Cantino map was composed by an anonymous Portuguese cartographer, and completed before November 1502, well before the Coelho expedition even set out. This has led to speculation that the island was discovered by a previous expedition. However, there is no consensus on which expedition that might have been. The name \"Quaresma\" means Lent, suggesting it must have been discovered in March or early April, which does not correspond well with the known expeditions. There is also a red island to the west of Quaresma in the Cantino map that does not fit with Fernando de Noronha island. Some have explained these anomalies away by reading quaresma as anaresma, making the proposed Lent timing unnecessary, and proposing that the red island is just an accidental inkblot.\n\nIf Quaresma is indeed Fernando de Noronha, then it is not known who discovered it. One proposal is that it was discovered by a royal Portuguese mapping expedition that was sent out in May 1501, commanded by an unknown captain (possibly André Gonçalves) and also accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci. The 1501 mapping expedition is also known as the \"Third Voyage\" of Amerigo Vespucci (and his first under the Portuguese flag). Vespucci relates the account of this expedition twice – first in a letter to Lorenzo Pietro Francesco di Medici, written in early 1503 (see (account) in Letter do Medici), and then again in his letters to Piero Soderini, written 1504–05 ([account] in Letter to Soderini). In his account, Vespucci does not mention the name of the captain of this 1501 mapping expedition, and his identity has been widely speculated on. The 16th-century chronicler Gaspar Correia suggests that it was André Gonçalves (Lendas da India, p.152). Greenlee (1945) conjectures that it might be Fernão de Loronha himself (a hypothesis also suggested by Duarte Leite (1923)). However, this is strongly disputed by other authors, e.g. Roukema (1963), who argue that it would be highly unlikely for a wealthy merchant like Loronha to personally command vessels himself. Loronha's support (if any) to the mapping expedition was probably limited to financing.\nAccording to Vespucci, this expedition returned to Lisbon in September 1502, just in time to influence the final composition of the Cantino map.  However, Vespucci does not report discovering this island then, instead stating that the first time he saw the island was on the 1503 Coelho expedition.\nThere is a letter written by Venetian emissary Pascualigo on October 12, 1502, saying that a ship arrived \"from the land of Parrots\" in Lisbon on July 22, 1502 (three months before Vespucci).  This could be a stray ship from the mapping expedition that returned prematurely, or another expedition altogether, about which there is no information. The timing of its reputed arrival (July 1502), makes it possible that it stumbled on the island some time in March 1502, on the homeward voyage, well within Lent.\nA third theory is that the island had already been discovered in 1500, shortly after the discovery of Brazil by the Second India Armada under Pedro Álvares Cabral. After his brief landfall at Porto Seguro, Cabral dispatched a supply ship under either Gaspar de Lemos or André Gonçalves  (sources conflict) back to Lisbon, to report the discovery.  This returning supply ship would have returned north along the Brazilian coast and might have come across Fernando de Noronha island, and reported its existence in Lisbon by July 1500. However, this contradicts the Quaresma name, since the returning supply ship was sailing well after Lent.\nA fourth possibility is that it was discovered by the Third India Armada of João da Nova, which set out from Lisbon in March or April 1501, and returned in September 1502, also in time to influence the Cantino map. Chronicler Gaspar Correia asserts that on the outward voyage, the Third Armada made a stop on the Brazilian coast around Cape Santo Agostinho. Two other chroniclers (João de Barros and Damião de Góis) do not mention a landfall, but do report they discovered an island (which they believe to be identified as Ascension Island, but this is not certain). It is thus possible that the Third Armada may have discovered Fernando de Noronha island on their outward leg. However, the timing is very tight: Easter landed on April 11, 1501, while the estimated departure date of the Third Armada from Lisbon ranges from March 5 to April 15, not leaving enough time to reach those environs within Lent.\nAs a result of these anomalies, some modern historians have proposed that Fernando de Noronha is not depicted on the 1502 Cantino map at all. Instead, they have proposed that Quaresma island and the accompanying red \"inkblot\" are in fact the Rocas Atoll, slightly misplaced on the map. This reserves the discovery of Fernando de Noronha island itself as indeed on August 10, 1503, by the Gonçalo Coelho expedition, as originally reported by Vespucci. Roukema concludes that it was the Rocas Atoll that was discovered by the returning stray ship or unrecorded expedition on March 16, 1502, well within Lent.\nThe name \"São João\" eventually gave way to the initially informal name of \"Fernando de Noronha\". A royal letter dated May 20, 1559, to descendants of the Loronha family, still refers to the island by its official name of ilha de São João., but already in other places, e.g. the logbook of Martim Afonso de Sousa in the 1530s, it was referred to as the \"island of Fernão de Noronha\" (\"Noronha\" being a common misspelling of \"Loronha\"). The informal name eventually displaced the official name.\n\n\n1500–1700\n\nThe Lisbon merchant Fernão de Loronha held not only Fernando de Noronha island as a hereditary captaincy but also (from 1503 to around 1512) a commercial monopoly on trade in Brazil. Between 1503 and 1512, Noronha's agents set up a string of warehouses (feitorias) along the Brazilian coast, and engaged in trade with the indigenous peoples in Brazil for brazilwood, a native red dye wood highly valued by European clothmakers.  Fernando de Noronha island was the central collection point of this network.  Brazilwood, continuously harvested by the coastal Indians and delivered to the various coastal warehouses, was shipped to the central warehouse on Fernando de Noronha island, which was intermittently visited by a larger transport ship that would carry the collected loads back to Europe. After the expiration of Loronha's commercial charter in 1512, the organization of the brazilwood enterprise was taken over by the Portuguese crown, but Loronha and his descendants retained private ownership of Fernando de Noronha island itself as a hereditary captaincy, at least down to the 1560s.\n\n\n1700–1900\n\nIn July 1719, the Welsh pirate Bartholomew Roberts, also known as \"Black Bart,\" was present on the island for a total of nine weeks, before heading off in search of Portuguese ships in the West Indies.\n\n\nFrench occupation\nIn 1736, the French East India Company sent an expedition commanded by Captain Lesquelin, with troops and resources to colonise the island. When finding out that the French had colonised the island, the Viceroy of Brazil, the Count of Galveias, sent scouts that verified the occupation, on 26 September 1736. King John V of Portugal determined that the French troops and colonisers were expelled, dispatching a royal charter on 26 May 1737 designating the Governor of Pernambuco, Henrique Luís Pereira Freire de Andrade, to comply with the resolution. At the same time, the Count of Galveias prepared an expedition with 250 soldiers, commanded by Colonel João Lobo de Lacerda, that sailed from Recife on 6 October 1737. Lacerda successfully expelled the French without resistance and returned to Recife on 11 July 1738.\nCaptain Henry Foster stopped at Fernando de Noronha during his scientific survey expedition as commander of HMS Chanticleer, which had set out in 1828. As well as surveying coasts and ocean currents, Foster used a Kater invariable pendulum to make observations on gravity. He took the island as the point of junction of his double line of longitudes setting out his survey. He was given considerable assistance by the Governor of Fernando Noronha who let Foster use part of his own house for the pendulum experiments. The longitude of Rio de Janeiro taken by Foster was among those on one side of a significant discrepancy, which meant that the charts of South America were in doubt.\n\nTo resolve this, the Admiralty instructed Captain Robert FitzRoy to command HMS Beagle on a survey expedition. One of its essential tasks was a stop at Fernando Noronha to confirm its exact longitude, using the 22 chronometers on board the ship to give the precise time of observations. They arrived at the island in the late evening of 19 February 1832, anchoring at midnight. On 20 February FizRoy landed a small party to take the observations, despite difficulties caused by heavy surf, then sailed on for Bahia, Brazil that evening.\nDuring the day, the island was visited by the naturalist Charles Darwin, who was one of the Beagle's passengers. He took notes for his book on geology. He wrote about admiring the woods: \n\n\"The whole island is one forest, & this is so thickly intertwined that it requires great exertion to crawl along. — The scenery was very beautiful, & large Magnolias & Laurels & trees covered with delicate flowers ought to have satisfied me. — But I am sure all the grandeur of the Tropics has not yet been seen by me. — We had no gaudy birds, No humming birds. No large flowers\".\nHis experiences on Fernando de Noronha were recorded in his journal, later published as The Voyage of the Beagle. He also included a short description of the island in his 1844 Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle.\nThe island was also used as a penal colony in the 19th century.\n\n\n1900–present\n\nIn the late 18th century, the first prisoners were sent to Fernando de Noronha. A prison was built. In 1897 the government of the state of Pernambuco took possession of the prison. Between 1938 and 1945, Fernando de Noronha was a political prison. In 1957 the prison was closed and the archipelago was visited by President Juscelino Kubitschek. However, in 1964 after a military coup, Miguel Arraes was incarcerated there for his refusal to resign as governor of Pernambuco.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the British arrived to provide technical cooperation in telegraphy (The South American Company). Later the French came with the French Cable and the Italians with Italcable.\nIn 1942, during World War II, the archipelago was made a Federal territory, which included Rocas Atoll and Saint Peter and Paul Rocks. The government sent political and ordinary prisoners to the local prison.\nAn airport was constructed in September 1942 by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command for the Natal-Dakar air route. It provided a transoceanic link between Brazil and French West Africa for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel during the Allies campaign in Africa. Brazil transferred the airport to the jurisdiction of the United States Navy on 5 September 1944. After the end of the war, the administration of the airport was transferred back to the Brazilian Government.\nThe geographic position of the airport averted a major air disaster on July 21, 1950. A BOAC Canadair C-4 Argonaut, with a crew of 7 and 12 passengers, en route to Natal from Dakar encountered severe engine problems which resulted, at one point, in both engines on the starboard wing being shut down. With only two functioning engines on the port wing, the reduction in power output caused the aircraft to steadily lose altitude from its normal cruising altitude of 20,000 ft (6,096 m) at a rate of 400 ft/min (2.03 m/s). A further difficulty was that the propeller on the inboard engine could not be feathered, which significantly increased aircraft drag. The crew also had to cope with a persistent fire on the same engine. As a result, the Captain ordered an SOS to be issued. The crew realised that they might not be able to reach Natal and would have to ditch in the South Atlantic. Consequently, the Captain decided to divert to Fernando de Noronha, 480 miles (773 km) to the southwest. En-route the crew managed to restart the outboard engine and this enabled the aircraft to maintain an altitude of 9,000 ft (2,743 m). Although there were problems with coolant temperature on the port wing engines plus difficulties in locating the small archipelago, the crew nursed the Argonaut to a safe landing at Fernando de Noronha, some four hours after their ordeal began.\nNowadays, Fernando de Noronha Airport is served by daily flights from Recife and Natal on the Brazilian coast.\nIn 1988, Brazil designated approximately 70% of the archipelago as a maritime national park, with the goal of preserving the land and sea environment. On October 5, 1988, the Federal Territory was dissolved and added to the state of Pernambuco (except Rocas Atoll, which was added to the state of Rio Grande do Norte).\nToday Fernando de Noronha's economy depends on tourism, restricted by the limitations of its delicate ecosystem. In addition to the historical interest noted above, the archipelago has been the subject of the attention of various scientists dedicated to the study of its flora, fauna, geology, etc.  The jurisdiction is considered to be a separate \"entity\" by the DX Century Club, and so is visited rather often by amateur radio operators.\nIn 2001, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared Fernando de Noronha, with Rocas Atoll, a World Heritage Site. It cited the following reasons: \n\na) the island's importance as a feeding ground for several species, including tuna, billfish, cetaceans, sharks, and marine turtles,\nb) a high population of resident spinner dolphins and\nc) protection for endangered species, such as the hawksbill sea turtle (critically endangered) and various birds.\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Fernando de Noronha. Rescue and recovery operations were launched from the island. Bodies and debris from the Airbus A330 operating the flight were recovered within five days. All 228 people on board were killed. The crash had been caused by the flight crew's inappropriate response to inaccurate airspeed readings due to the pitot tubes being blocked, with the first officer (who was the pilot flying) pulling the nose up, which caused the aircraft to enter a stall and crash.\n\n\nGeography\n\n\nGeology\nThe islands of this archipelago are the visible parts of a range of submerged mountains. It consists of 21 islands, islets and rocks of volcanic origin. The main island has an area of 18 km2 (6.9 sq mi), being 10 km (5.4 nmi; 6.2 mi) long and 3.5 km (1.9 nmi; 2.2 mi) wide at its maximum. The base of this enormous volcanic formation is 756 m (2,480 ft) below the surface. The volcanic rocks are of variable, though mainly silica-undersaturated, character with basanite, nephelinite and phonolite among the lava types found. The main island, from which the group gets its name, makes up 91% of the total area; the islands of Rata, Sela Gineta, Cabeluda and São José, together with the islets of Leão and Viúva make up the rest. The central upland of the main island is called the Quixaba.\n\n\nFlora\nThe United Nations Environment Programme lists 15 possible endemic plant species, including species of the genera Capparis noronhae (two species), Ceratosanthes noronhae (three species), Cayaponia noronhae (two species), Moriordica noronhae, Cereus insularis, Palicourea noronhae, Guettarda noronhae, Bumelia noronhae, Physalis noronhae, and Ficus noronhae.\n\n\nFauna\nThe islands have two endemic birds: the Noronha elaenia (Elaenia ridleyana) and the Noronha vireo (Vireo gracilirostris). Both are present on the main island; the Noronha vireo is also present on Ilha Rata. In addition there is an endemic subspecies of eared dove (Zenaida auriculata noronha). Subfossil remains of an extinct endemic rail have also been found. The archipelago is also an important site for breeding seabirds. An endemic sigmodontine rodent (Noronhomys vespuccii), mentioned by Amerigo Vespucci, is now extinct. The islands have two endemic reptiles, the Noronha wormlizard (Amphisbaena ridleyi) and the Noronha skink (Trachylepis atlantica).\n\n\nMarine life\nThe life above and below sea is the main attraction of the island. Sea turtles, cetaceans (most common among these are spinner dolphins and humpback whales, followed by many others such as pantropical spotted dolphins, short-finned pilot whales, and melon-headed whales), albatrosses, and many other species are frequently observed.\n\n\nClimate\nFernando de Noronha has a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw/As), with two well-defined seasons for rainfall, if not temperature. The rainy season lasts from February to July; the rest of the year sees little rain. The temperature ranges, both diurnal and monthly, are unusually slight.\n\n\nConservation and environmental threats\nMost of the original large trees were cut down in the 19th century, when the island was used as a prison, for firewood and to keep the prisoners from hiding and making rafts.\nAlso, exotic species have been introduced:\n\nLinseed, intended for use as cattle feed.\nTegu lizards (Tupinambis merianae, locally known as teju) introduced in the 1950s to control a rat infestation. It did not work because Tegus are diurnal and rats, nocturnal. The lizards are now considered a plague, feeding mostly on bird eggs.\nRock cavies (Kerodon rupestris, locally known as mocó) introduced by the military in the 1960s as hunting game for soldiers.\nDomestic cats, introduced as pets, now they spread throughout the whole island and several acquired a feral status, surviving only by preying on native birds, rock cavies and synanthropic rodents.\nFrom these, the domestic cat and the tegu lizard have become invasive.\nThe island is divided between the Fernando de Noronha Marine National Park and the Fernando de Noronha Environmental Protection Area. The latter covers the urban, tourist area.\n\n\nEnergy\nUntil 2025, energy production in the Fernando de Noronha archipelago is carried out at the Tubarão plant, which runs on biodiesel.\nIn November 2025, the archipelago's first floating solar plant is inaugurated, built by Neoenergia (Iberdrola's subsidiary in Brazil) and Companhia Pernambucana de Saneamento (Compesa).\nThis plant is located on the water surface of the Xaréu reservoir. It has a capacity of 622 kWp and an estimated annual generation of 1,083 MWh. The installation will prevent the emission of 717 tons of CO₂.\nThe Noronha Verde project has also been launched, developed by Neoenergia, aiming to make Fernando de Noronha the first inhabited oceanic island in Latin America to achieve a 100% sustainable energy model. It consists of a photovoltaic plant with more than 30,000 panels and a capacity of 22 MWp, which will be integrated with a 49 MWh battery storage system.\n\n\nEconomy\nTourism including dolphin watching, diving, and charter fishing comprise the majority of the island's economy.\n\n\nEconomic indicators\n\nThe archipelago of Fernando de Noronha in 2005 had a gross domestic product (GDP) of R$22,802,000 and a per capita income of R$10,001.  In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme estimated the Fernando de Noronha state district's Human Development Index (HDI) at 0.862. The only two banking centers in the archipelago are a branch of Banco Santander Brasil and a branch of Banco Bradesco. There are one or two additional automated teller machines (ATMs) around the main island.\n\n\nTourism\n\nThe beaches of Fernando de Noronha are promoted for tourism and recreational diving. The most popular ones include Baía do Sancho, Pig Bay, Dolphins Bay, Sueste Bay and Praia do Leão. Due to the South Equatorial Current that pushes warm water from Africa to the island, diving to depths of 30 to 40 m (98 to 131 ft) does not require a wetsuit. The visibility underwater can reach up to 50 m (164 ft).\nThe part of the island facing the mainland has the beaches in the following order: Baía do Sancho, Baía dos Porcos, Praia da Cacimba do Padre, Praia do Bode, Praia dos Americanos, Praia do Boldró, Praia da Conceição, Praia do Meio and Praia do Cachorro. The part of the island facing the Atlantic Ocean has only three beaches: Praia do Leão, Praia do Sueste and Praia do Atalaia. A great way to get to know the island is to walk from Praia dos Americanos, pass by Praia do Boldró, Praia da Conceição, Praia do Meio and finish the walking at Praia do Cachorro.\nThe island is served by Governador Carlos Wilson Airport with regular flights to Natal and Recife.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\nNoronha hotspot\nPolitics of Pernambuco\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\nDuarte Leite (1923) \"O Mais antigo mapa do Brasil\" in História da Colonização Portuguesa do Brasil, vol.2, pp. 221–81.\nGreenlee, W.B.

{"eco_id": 201, "eco_name": "Hampton mallee and woodlands", "wiki_title": "Hampton bioregion", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_bioregion", "extract_text": "Hampton is an interim Australian bioregion located in southeastern coastal Western Australia, with a small portion (4%) extending into adjacent South Australia. It has an area of 1,088,198 hectares (2,689,000 acres). The Hampton bioregion is part of the Coolgardie woodlands ecoregion.\n\n\nGeography\nThe bioregion includes a coastal plain, known as the Roe Plains, covered by extensive marine dunes, with a limestone escarpment, known as the Hampton Tableland or Hampton Range, emerging to the north of the dune fields. The bioregion is bounded on the north by the Nullarbor Plain, and on the south by the Great Australian Bight.\nThe escarpment is an outcrop of the Eucla Basin, a sedimentary geologic basin that extends under the entire region as well as the Nullarbor Plain to the north and under the sea to the south. Erosion of the Eucla Basin's limestone by rainwater and groundwater has created a karst landscape, with extensive underground sinkholes and caverns.\nThe region has a semi-arid Mediterranean climate, with mild to hot summers and cool to mild winters. The bioregion receives about 250mm of rainfall annually, mostly during the winter months.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe plant communities of the bioregion include mallee woodlands and shrublands on scree slopes, limestone pavements, and dunes. They are characterised by mallee, shrubs or trees, generally eucalypts, with multiple stems rising from an underground woody base called a lignotuber. An endemic subspecies of coastal white mallee, Eucalyptus diversifolia hesperia, is a common mallee species. Mallee with patches of acacia scrub, featuring ridge-fruited mallee (Eucalyptus angulosa), coastal wattle (Acacia cyclops), Calothamnus quadrifidus, and granite bottlebrush (Melaleuca elliptica), is found on coastal dunes. Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) is found on limestone and lime sands.\nThere are eucalypt woodlands, and open low woodlands of western myall (Acacia papyrocarpa) over bluebush (Maireana sp.), on the alluvial and calcareous plains below the escarpment. The hemiparasitic desert quandong or native peach (Santalum acuminatum) is found in the woodlands. Low dune vegetation, including Scaevola crassifolia and Atriplex cinerea, are found on more recent dune deposits.\nNative birds include the malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) and western subspecies of grey currawong (Strepera versicolor plumbei) and slender-billed thornbill (Acanthiza iredalei iredalei). The dunes are home to three endemic species of reptiles, Pseudemoia baudini, Lerista arenicola, and Lerista baynesi, along with one endemic sub-species (Ctenotus brooksi euclae).\nSeveral species of cave fauna are endemic to the cave systems of the bioregion, which extend under the adjacent Nullarbor Plain. These include the spiders Tartarus mullamullangensis and Tartarus nurinensis.\n\n\nThreats\nThreats to the bioregion include overgrazing by sheep, invasive animals like foxes, wild dogs, feral cats, starlings, camels, horses and rabbits, and invasive plants like Ward's weed (Carrichtera annua) and sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias).\n\n\nProtected areas\nProtected areas include Nuytsland Nature Reserve and Eucla National Park in Western Australia, and Nullarbor National Park which protects the entire South Australian section.\nThe Eyre Bird Observatory is located in coastal mallee woodland in Nuytsland Nature Reserve. It was established in 1977, and includes a natural history library and a small museum.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nThackway, R and I D Cresswell (1995) An interim biogeographic regionalisation for Australia : a framework for setting priorities in the National Reserves System Cooperative Program Version 4.0 Canberra : Australian Nature Conservation Agency, Reserve Systems Unit, 1995.

The island had never been inhabited until 1820, when the French family of Rosier moved to it. The island officially became a possession of France in 1897, though it is claimed by Madagascar.\nThe island, garrisoned by a detachment from Réunion, has a weather station and is visited by scientists.  Though uninhabited now, it is part of the Scattered Islands of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands administrative region.\nEuropa Island was the setting of \"Search in the Deep\", a 1968 episode of The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, partly focusing on the breeding habits of the green sea turtle.\n\n\nDescription\nEuropa is 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) in diameter, with a maximum altitude of 6 metres (20 ft), and has 22.2 kilometres (13.8 mi) of coastline. It is surrounded by coral beaches and a fringing reef and encloses a mangrove lagoon of around 9 square kilometres (3.5 sq mi) and open to the sea on one side.\nThere are no ports or harbours but anchorage is possible offshore.  Its exclusive economic zone, contiguous with that of Bassas da India, is 127,300 square kilometres (49,200 sq mi).  The airstrip is 1,500 metres (4,920 ft) metres long.\n\n\nEcology\n\nThe island is a nature reserve.  Its vegetation consists of dry forest, scrub, Euphorbia, the mangrove swamp, and the remains of a sisal plantation.  It is one of the world's largest nesting sites for green sea turtles. It is also home to goats introduced by settlers in the late 18th century.\nThe island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports a large and diverse population of breeding seabirds and other waterbirds.  It is the only known breeding site outside Aldabra and Madagascar for Malagasy pond herons. Seabirds include the second largest colony in the western Indian Ocean of great frigatebirds (with up to 1100 pairs), tropical shearwaters (up to 100 pairs, probably of the subspecies Puffinus bailloni bailloni previously considered endemic to the Mascarene Islands), dimorphic egrets and Caspian terns.\nEuropa is home to an endemic subspecies of white-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus europae), three kinds of landbird (including an endemic subspecies of the Malagasy white-eye) and its own species of hissing cockroach.\n\n\nClimate\nEuropa Island's climate is affected by the Agulhas Current with water temperatures usually above 30 °C (86 °F), southeast trade winds during the (austral) winter and occasional cyclones. The climate can be described as a semi-arid and tropical combination with wet summers and dry winters.\n\n\nHistory\nWhile the island has probably been sighted by navigators since at least the 16th century, it takes its name from the British ship Europa, which visited it in December 1774. Ruins and graves on Europa island attest to several attempts at settlement from the 1860s to the 1920s.  For example, the French Rosiers family moved to the island in 1860, but subsequently abandoned it. The Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean are partially claimed by the Comoros, Madagascar, and Mauritius. The Malagasy and Mauritian claims, however, are significantly later than their access to independence. However, the agreement reached in October 2024 on the restitution to Mauritius of the Chagos Islands by the United Kingdom, in the heart of the Indian Ocean, notably home to the American base of Diego Garcia, has relaunched the debate in Madagascar.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nWarne, Kennedy (April 2014). \"A tale of two atolls\".

It has one of the most diverse herbaceous plant floras of ecoregions in North America.\n\n\nSetting\nThis is a large region, mainly of rolling plain except for the Ozark plateau and other smaller areas of plateau and basin in Kentucky and Tennessee. The region contains the large system of sandstone caves in Mammoth Cave National Park.\nThe region was designated by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and is a fraction of what others consider the Central Hardwood Forest of the Central Hardwood Region, which would include the northern hardwood forest to the north.\n\n\nFlora\nThe pre-Columbian dominant ecosystems in this region were oak savannas with woodlands and forests of oak and hickory. Today only small areas of oak and hickory woodland remain, mixed with dogwoods, sassafras trees and hop hornbeams. The ecoregion contains large areas of prairie as well as wetter meadows that are home to tulip trees and sweetgums.\n\n\nFauna\nBirds of the woodlands include vireos and tanagers while mammals include bobcats, white-tailed deer, Eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons and opossums.\n\n\nThreats\nThe dominance of oak in this part of the pre-Columbian savannas of North America was due to frequent fires.  The fire suppression policies since the 1930s have been a significant forest disturbance.\nToday there is very little intact habitat in this ecoregion, with a reduction of bottomland hardwood forests by 70–95%, and only 0.02 percent of the original oak savannas remain.  Although much of the area is forested, these forests tend to be highly fragmented and significantly altered by development, agriculture, and fire suppression.  The forests are dominated primarily by oak and hickory species, but succession has filled the understory with maples and yellow poplar and blocking oak regeneration.  In some areas, habitat is threatened by urbanization and invasive species such as non-native privet, honeysuckle, garlic mustard and kudzu. Significant natural areas in the ecoregion include: Wolf River (Tennessee), the Cedar glades and the western Highland Rim of Tennessee;  Mammoth Cave National Park; the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area of Tennessee and Kentucky; Hoosier National Forest and Yellowwood State Forest in southern Indiana; the Edge of Appalachia Preserve in Ohio; the Cache River (Illinois) wetlands and the Shawnee Hills in southern Illinois; and the Ozarks in Missouri including Mark Twain National Forest.

They lie approximately 458 kilometres (285 mi) from Socorro Island south and southwest of Cabo San Lucas, the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, and 698 to 1,092 kilometres (434 to 679 mi) west of Manzanillo. Historically linked to the Mexican state of Colima, to which they were granted in 1861 to establish a penal colony, the islands are under Mexican federal property and jurisdiction.\nIn July 2016, the Revillagigedo Archipelago was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in November 2017 they were declared to be a marine reserve and a national park of Mexico. Some of the volcanoes are active, with the last eruption of Volcán Bárcena in 1953, and Socorro in 1993. Travelling to the islands from their nearest land point takes approximately 26 to 30 hours, as they are typically reached by sea; a small military airstrip exists on Socorro.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe total area is 157.81 km2 (60.93 mi2), spread over an east-to-west extent of about 420 km (261 mi). A naval station in the south of Socorro Island has a population of 45 (staff). On Clarión is a small naval garrison with nine men. The islands are otherwise uninhabited. The islands are named after Don Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the 53rd viceroy of New Spain.\n\nThe three eastern islands are called the inner islands. They fall in the time zone UTC-7 (Mountain Time), while the major part of Colima is UTC-6 (Central Time Zone). Clarión is comparatively far to the west, by more than 200 km in comparison with the inner islands, and in UTC-8 (Pacific Time Zone). The Revillagigedo Islands are one of three Mexican island groups in the Pacific Ocean that are not on the continental shelf; the others are Guadalupe Island and Rocas Alijos.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nSixteenth to nineteenth century\n\nNo evidence of human habitation on any of the islands exists before their discovery by Spanish explorers. Hernando de Grijalva and his crew discovered an uninhabited island on 19 December 1533, and named it Santo Tomás (Socorro Island) and on 28 December they discovered Isla de los Inocentes (San Benedicto) which owed its name to having been found on the day of the Holy Innocents.\nIn November 1542, Ruy López de Villalobos, while exploring new routes across the Pacific, rediscovered Inocentes and Santo Tomás and charted the latter as Anublada (\"Cloudy\"). Villalobos was the first to report sighting of Roca Partida Island giving it its present-day name. In 1608, Martín Yánez de Armida, in charge of another expedition, visited Anublada and changed its name to Socorro. In 1779 José Camacho was the first to report sighting of the island remaining, that he charted as Santa Rosa (\"Saint Rose\"). Santa Rosa was later renamed Clarion after the vessel commanded by Henry Gyzelaar at that time.\nThe Revillagigedo Islands have been visited by a number of other explorers: Domingo del Castillo (1541), Miguel Pinto (1772), Alexander von Humboldt (1811), Benjamin Morrell (1825), Sir Edward Belcher (1839) who made the first botanical collections and Reeve, who witnessed the eruption of Mount Evermann in 1848. On 25 July 1861, President Benito Juárez signed a decree awarding territorial control over the four islands to the state of Colima. His plan was to build an offshore penitentiary on Isla Socorro; although this never happened, the decree whereby they were attached to Colima has never been repealed. In 1865, the island was explored by ornithologist Andrew Jackson Grayson, who discovered the Socorro dove, Socorro mockingbird and the Socorro elf owl which were later given scientific names in his honor.\n\n\nTwentieth century\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Dr. Barton Warren Evermann, director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, California, promoted the scientific exploration of the islands. The most comprehensive biological collections were obtained at this time. The volcano on Isla Socorro was renamed in his honor. In 1957 the Mexican Navy established a naval base on Socorro and has had a permanent presence on the island since then.  A tiny outpost also exists on Clarión, as noted above. On  21 March 1972, Pablo Silva García became the first Governor of Colima to visit his state's island territories. A plaque was unveiled to mark the event and cement Colima's claim.\nThe seas surrounding the larger islands are popular with scuba divers; a variety of marine life such as cetaceans, sharks and manta rays can be observed. Visitors usually stay aboard expedition vessels during their visit to the islands, which is desirable from an ecological standpoint to prevent introduction of further invasive species. The islands are considered dangerous to visit for purposes beyond diving since it is difficult to make a landing; some have nearly lost their lives attempting to do so on Clarion for example.\nThey are occasionally visited by amateur radio operators, who usually use the ITU prefix XF4.  Because of their distance from the mainland, for award credit they are considered to be an \"entity\" separate from Mexico. Expeditions from organizations engaged in biological conservation of the islands visit the islands for fieldwork on a regular basis. No tourism facilities exist; the islands have no reliable sources of fresh water of their own.\n\n\nTwenty-first century\nOn 24 November 2017, President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto created North America's largest marine protected area around the Revillagigedo Islands. This protected area covers 150,000 square kilometres (57,000 mi2) around the islands, and bans fishing, mining, and tourism development in the protected area and on the islands.\n\n\nEcology\nThe Revillagigedo Islands are home to many endemic plant and animal species, and are sometimes called Mexico's \"little Hawaii\". They are recognized as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, part of the Neotropical realm. Socorro is the most diverse in flora, fauna, and topography. The Mexican Government established the islands as a Biosphere Reserve on June 4, 1994. Oceanographic Magazine stated in 2020 that, \"Its remoteness, protection and peculiar oceanography makes it one of the most biodiverse and exciting marine destinations on earth.\"\nThe islands are mostly covered with tropical dry forest, with several distinct plant communities that vary with elevation, soils, and exposure. Hopbush (Dodonaea viscosa) and Guettarda insularis are common dry forest species. Green buttonwood mangrove (Conocarpus erectus) and the shrub Hibiscus tiliaceus subsp. pernambucensis grow along the seacoast.\n\nAccording to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), 14 of the islands' 16 generally accepted resident taxa of landbirds are endemic, and include the Clarión wren (Troglodytes tanneri), Socorro wren (Troglodytes sissonii), Socorro mockingbird (Mimus graysoni), Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni), and Socorro parakeet (Arahuga brevipes). Clarión is home to endemic subspecies of burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia rostrata), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura clarionensis), and common raven (Corvus corax clarionensis). A variety of yellow-crowned night heron, Nyctanassa violacea bancrofti (gravirostris), is endemic to Socorro. Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis) is a seabird that breeds only around Cerro Evermann on Socorro. It formerly bred on Clarión and San Benedicto, but has not bred on Clarión since 1988 nor on San Benedicto since 1952.\nThe islands' four native terrestrial vertebrates are all endemic, and include a whip snake (Masticophis anthonyi), a night snake (Hypsiglena unaocularis) and two iguanids (Urosaurus auriculatus and U. clarionensis). Numerous seabird taxa breed no further north(east)wards than San Benedicto; storm-petrels are notably absent as breeders though they breed in the region and visit the islands to forage. Albatrosses are also not normally found here. Among landbirds, the absence of the house finch, widespread on northeastern Pacific offshore islands, is the most conspicuous one.\nApart from the native birds, migrant shorebirds and others are often found on the islands. Bahia Azufre (Sulfur Bay) on Clarión seems to be a favorite stopover location, as it is one of the few longer stretches of beach in the islands; mostly, the shoreline is steep cliffs. The archipelago is also a part of wintering grounds for humpback whales in the North Pacific.\nSocorro has numerous endemic plant taxa, whereas Clarión has only a few. The San Benedicto ecosystem was nearly wiped out in the devastating eruption of Bárcena volcano on August 1, 1952. The ecosystem there has since recovered, but the event is known to have caused the extinction of the San Benedicto rock wren. Most if not all native plants found on San Benedicto today are shared with Clarión, but not with the closer Socorro to the south, due to the prevailing winds and ocean currents. The native flora of Clarión is about equally shared with both other large islands.\nAs opposed to the interchange between the islands, the animals and plants that colonized them initially are apparently all from mainland populations generally to the northeastward of the Revillagigedos. Plants are most often derived from Baja California founder populations, whereas the endemic nonavian reptiles seem to be rather derived directly from mainland populations of the Sonora-Sinaloa area. The ancestors of the islands' terrestrial birds probably came from the general area of southern North and northern Central America. As illustrated by the fact that no endemic landbird taxon occurs on more than one island and the cases of the Socorro and Clarión wrens as well as the Socorro dove and Clarión mourning dove, each bird population seems to have arisen independently. The archipelago has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for its breeding seabirds and endemic landbirds.\nIlex socorroensis, Aristolochia socorroensis, Bidens socorrensis, Coreocarpus insularis, Eremosis littoralis, Erigeron socorrensis, Perityle socorrosensis, Zapoteca formosa subsp. socorrensis, Lepechinia hastata subsp. socorrensis, Salvia pseudomisella, Triumfetta socorrensis, Botrychium socorrense, Acianthera unguicallosa, Castilleja bryantii var. socorrensis, Peperomia socorronis, Muhlenbergia solisii, Paspalum longum, Guettarda insularis, Meliosma nesites, Cestrum pacificum, Physalis mimulus, Citharexylum danirae, and Verbena sphaerocarpa are endemic to Socorro. Portulaca masonii is endemic to Clarión. Aristolochia islandica and Erigeron crenatus are endemic to San Benedicto. Plants endemic to two or more islands include Cryptantha foliosa, Bulbostylis nesiotica, Cyperus duripes, Croton masonii, Teucrium townsendii, Oenothera resicum, Aristida tenuifolia, Aristida vaginata, Spermacoce nesiotica, and Nicotiana stocktonii.\n\n\nThreats and conservation\n\nAs late as 1956, it was said that:\n\n\"The future of the avifauna of the islands appears to be secure at present. There are no human inhabitants, and no mammals of any kind except the moderate and apparently stable population of sheep on Socorro.\"\nBut the unique ecology of the islands has since then come under threat from introduced species. The sheep were introduced to Socorro in 1869. Cats became established after 1953, probably in the early 1970s. Pigs were introduced to Clarión in 1979, and rabbits became feral at some earlier date.\nSeveral endemic species of Socorro are now threatened with extinction. The Socorro mockingbird (Mimodes graysoni) numbers fewer than 400 individuals altogether. The endemic Socorro parakeet (Psittacara brevipes) and Townsend's shearwater (Puffinus auricularis), are also endangered. The Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni) is now extinct in the wild, but is being bred in captivity. The elf owl's Socorro subspecies Micrathene whitneyi graysoni appears to be extinct. Other plant and animal taxa in the archipelago are also considered threatened or nearly so.\nA number of conservation initiatives are dedicated to halting the destruction of the native ecosystems of the islands. Dr. Harmunt Walter of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Dr. Luis F. Baptista of the California Academy of Sciences have coordinated breeding and reintroduction efforts for the Socorro dove since 1988, through the Island Endemics Institute. The Comité Científico para la Conservación y Restauración del Archipiélago Revillagigedo (\"Scientific Committee for the Conservation and Restoration of the Revillagigedo Islands\") was founded in 1996, and is a committee representing several organizations, including the Island Conservation & Ecology Group, Island Endemics Institute, the University of Missouri–St. Louis (UMSL), the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and others. It is chaired by Dr. Walter and Dr. Luis Medrano of UNAM is its secretary. The committee has been advocating removal of the exotic species from the islands, especially the estimated 2000 sheep on Socorro, to allow the islands' ecology to recover, and adoption of a management plan to promote the recovery of the islands' native species, including reintroduction of the Socorro dove.\nBrattstrom and Howell who gave the optimistic outlook in 1956 went on to caution:\n\n\"it may be hoped that the Mexican government will guard against the introduction of mammals such as rabbits, cats, goats and others that have invariably brought disaster to the flora and fauna of insular regions.\"\n\n\nMarine protected area\nOn 25 November 2017, President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto acted to protect the biodiversity of the region by creating North America's largest marine protected area around the islands, and prohibiting mining, fishing, and tourism development on or near the islands. In total, marine protected areas cover 4.6% of Mexico's exclusive economic zone for fishing. Marine protected areas have been shown to positively contribute to ocean diversity, improve nearby fishing locations, and combat climate change.  A study published five years after the establishment of the marine protected area found that fishing activity within the protected zone had decreased by an average of 82% per vessel. The study also found that industrial fishing catches in Mexico's exclusive economic zone had not decreased.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund, ed.

{"eco_id": 202, "eco_name": "Jarrah-Karri forest and shrublands", "wiki_title": "Warren bioregion", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_bioregion", "extract_text": "Warren, also known as Karri Forest Region and the Jarrah-Karri forest and shrublands ecoregion, is a biogeographic region in southern Western Australia. Located in the southwest corner of Western Australia between Cape Naturaliste and Albany, it is bordered to the north and east by the Jarrah Forest region. Its defining characteristic is an extensive tall forest of Eucalyptus diversicolor (karri). This occurs on dissected, hilly ground, with a moderately wet climate. Karri is a valuable timber and much of the karri forest has been logged over, but less than a third has been cleared for agriculture. Recognised as a region under the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA), and as a terrestrial ecoregion by the World Wide Fund for Nature, it was first defined by Ludwig Diels in 1906.\n\n\nGeography and geology\nThe Warren region is defined as the coastal sandplain between Cape Naturaliste and Albany. Extending from the ocean to the edge of the Yilgarn craton plateau, for most of its extent it may be adequately approximated as the land within ten kilometres (6.2 miles) of the coast. North of Point D'Entrecasteaux, however, it extends inland almost as far as Nannup and Manjimup. It has an area of about 8,300 square kilometres (3,200 mi2), making it about 2.7% of the South West Province, 0.3% of the state, and 0.1% of Australia. It is bounded to the north and east by the Jarrah Forest region. Much of the region is unpopulated, but there are a number of towns with substantial populations, most notably Margaret River, Augusta, Pemberton, Walpole, Denmark and Albany.\n\nWarren has a hilly topography, caused by two factors: the underlying geology, which consists of infolded metamorphic rock of the Leeuwin Complex and Archaean granite of the Albany-Fraser Orogen; and the dissection of rivers such as the Blackwood, Warren, Shannon and Frankland. The western extent of the region takes in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge, an 80 kilometres (50 miles) long strip of coastal limestone on top of a ridge of granite, with an extensive cave system. There are a number of soil types, including hard setting loamy soil, lateritic soil, leached sandy soil and Holocene marine dunes.\n\n\nClimate\nWarren has a moderate Mediterranean climate. It has the highest rainfall in the state, with annual falls of from 650 to 1,500 millimetres (26 to 59 inches), and a short dry season of only three to four months.\n\n\nVegetation and flora\n\nThe characteristic vegetation of the Warren region is the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), at 90m the tallest trees in Australia, in association with the three tingle trees, which are endemic to this coast: rates tingle (E. brevistylis), red tingle (E. jacksonii) and yellow tingle (E. guilfoylei). Karri has a thick undergrowth of flowers and shrubs such as coral vine (Kennedia coccinea). The most important plant families are Fabaceae (including the colourful wisteria, Hardenbergia comptoniana), Orchidaceae, Mimosaceae, Myrtaceae and Proteaceae.\nThe karri forest occurs in deep loam, and covers nearly half of the region. Although very moist in winter, it is not considered to be a rainforest because the dry season precludes the establishment of a characteristic rainforest understory of epiphytes, liverworts, ferns and mosses. Some rainforest relict species do occur, however, such as Anthocercis sylvicola, Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis) and wild plum (Podocarpus drouynianus).\nThe poorer, lateritic soils, about a quarter of the region, are vegetated by medium forest of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), which can grow up to 40m tall, and marri (Corymbia calophylla) (up to 60m). Other significant vegetation forms include low woodland of E. marginata and Banksia species (8%); Agonis flexuosa woodlands or scrub on Holocene marine dunes (5%); and swamps supporting sedges (5%) or low woodlands of Melaleuca (4%).\nAs of 2007, the Warren is known to contain 1865 indigenous vascular plant species, and a further 419 naturalised alien species. The endangered flora of the Warren region consists of 28 species, with a further 160 species having been declared Priority Flora under the Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List.\nThe region is considered one of the most important centres of plant endemism in the South West. As well as the three tingle trees other species endemic to the region include Corymbia ficifolia (red flowering gum). The area around Albany is especially rich in endemics such as Cephalotus follicularis.\n\n\nFauna\nThe Warren region supports a rich diversity of fauna, much of which is apparently Gondwanan in origin. Mammal species include the western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis), chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii) (particularly found in Jarrah forest), the squirrel-like brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), quokka (Setonix brachyurus), yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes leucogaster), southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), and woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi). The first four of these are endangered species and numbers of many of the indigenous marsupials have declined as their habitats are removed and altered.\nAs with the rest of southwest Australia, in contrast to comparable forest of the south east, there is a low diversity of bird species. Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions. Exceptions include the red-eared firetail (Stagonopleura oculata) and the white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana), both of which occur only in the karri forest; the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis) and western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), all of which inhabit the region's heath vegetation; and the noisy scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus), which inhabits densely vegetated gullies. Other forest birds include the purple-crowned lorikeet.\nInsects include an endemic spider Moggridgea tingle.\nThe freshwater streams of the Warren region support only a low diversity of fauna, but much of it is highly endemic. A number of frog species are endemic or nearly so, including the orange-bellied frog (Geocrinia vitellina), the white-bellied frog (Geocrinia alba), and the sunset frog (Spicospina flammocaerulea). Endemic freshwater invertebrates include  worms of the family Phreodrilidea, and crayfish of the genera Cherax and Engaewa.\n\n\nLand use\n\nThe Warren region falls entirely within what the Department of Agriculture and Food calls the \"Intensive Land-use Zone\" (ILZ), the area of Western Australia that has been largely cleared and developed for intensive agriculture such as cropping and livestock production. Despite this, only a small amount of the region's natural vegetation has been cleared and given over to agriculture. The proportion of cleared land was calculated as 13.2% in 2002, although Beard gave a much larger figure of 31% in 1984. The remaining land is considered to be native vegetation, but this need not be pristine; a substantial proportion of the remaining native vegetation has been degraded by selective logging and other human activities.\n\nHistorically, logging was the primary land use in the region, and this remains a significant industry. There has been substantial selective logging in the region, and some clearfelling. There has also previously been some bauxite mining in the area, but this has now ceased, and the mining areas are at least partially reforested. Dams have also been constructed in high-rainfall forest areas.\nThe most important land uses for the region are now biodiversity conservation and tourism. More than half of the remaining vegetation is now in protected areas, including Shannon National Park, D'Entrecasteaux National Park, Mount Frankland National Park, Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park and Walpole-Nornalup National Park. These contain numerous tourist attractions, most notably the Walpole-Nornalup National Park's Valley of the Giants, which includes a \"Tree Top Walk\".\n\n\nConservation\nThe main threat to the biodiversity of the Warren region is the South West's epidemic of dieback, a disease caused by the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Introduced animals such as feral cats, foxes and rats prey on native wildlife and occupy ecological niches to the detriment of native species. Populations are controlled through 1080 baiting as part of the highly successful Western Shield program. Other threats include human activities related to infrastructure and silviculture, such as roads changing surface runoff patterns, and changes to the fire regime.\nBecause so much of the Warren region is already protected, it has low priority under Australia's National Reserve System.\n\n\nProtected areas\n45.47% of the ecoregion is classified as a terrestrial protected area. Terrestrial connectivity is rated at 42.5%. Protected areas include:\n\nBoorara-Gardner National Park\nBoyndaminup National Park\nBramley National Park\nBrockman National Park\nD'Entrecasteaux National Park\nEaster National Park\nForest Grove National Park\nGloucester National Park\nGreater Beedelup National Park\nGreater Dordagup National Park\nGreater Hawke National Park\nHilliger National Park\nJane National Park\nLeeuwin-Naturaliste National Park\nMount Frankland National Park\nMount Frankland North National Park\nMount Frankland South National Park\nMount Lindesay National Park\nMount Mason Nature Reserve\nMount Roe National Park\nMount Shadforth Nature Reserve\nSir James Mitchell National Park\nScott National Park\nShannon National Park\nTorndirrup National Park\nTwo Peoples Bay Nature Reserve\nWalpole-Nornalup National Park\nWarren National Park\nWest Cape Howe National Park\nWilliam Bay National Park\n\n\nBiogeography\n\nThe Warren region first appeared in Ludwig Diels' 1906 biogeographical regionalisation of Western Australia. Diels' concept of Warren region was effectively all the land south of a line from Albany to Busselton; thus it included a substantial area east of Margaret River that is now part of the Jarrah Forest region. The region was not recognised as one of Edward de Courcy Clarke's \"natural regions\" in 1926, but was resurrected in Charles Gardner's regionalisations of the 1940s and 1950s.\nIn 1980, John Stanley Beard published a phytogeographical regionalisation of the state based on data from the Vegetation Survey of Western Australia. This new regionalisation included a \"Warren Botanical District\" that is essentially identical with the present-day Warren. By 1984, Beard's phytogeographic regions were being presented more generally as \"natural regions\", and as such were given more widely recognisable names. Thus the \"Warren Botanical District\" became the \"Karri Forest Region\".\nWhen the IBRA was published in the 1990s, Beard's regionalisation was used as the baseline for Western Australia. The Warren region was accepted as defined by Beard, but reverted to the name \"Warren\". It has since survived a number of revisions. When the IBRA subregions were introduced in IBRA Version 6.1, the whole of Warren was defined as a single subregion.\nUnder the World Wildlife Fund's biogeographic regionalisation of the world's terrestrial surface into \"ecoregions\", the Warren region is equivalent to the Jarrah-Karri forest and shrublands ecoregion of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBerry, Christopher (1987).

{"eco_id": 97, "eco_name": "Kalahari xeric savanna", "wiki_title": "Kalahari Desert", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalahari_Desert", "extract_text": "The Kalahari Desert is a large semiarid sandy savanna in Southern Africa covering 900,000 km2 (350,000 sq mi), including much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.\n\n\nEtymology\nKalahari is derived from the Tswana word Kgala, meaning \"the great thirst\", or Kgalagadi, meaning \"a waterless place\"; the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface hot.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Kalahari Desert was not always an arid environment. Geological and paleoclimatic evidence suggests that during parts of the late Pleistocene, the region experienced significantly wetter and cooler conditions. Fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in northwestern Botswana indicate that the area supported more abundant vegetation and permanent water sources between roughly 30,000 and 11,000 Before Present (BP), with the most humid period occurring after 17,500 BP. Sediment cores, pollen records, and fossilized animal remains from other parts of the Kalahari, including the Makgadikgadi Pans and Okavango Basin, corroborate these findings, showing evidence of large paleolakes and river systems that once covered much of what is now desert.\nDuring these wetter phases, the Kalahari likely supported populations of large mammals such as antelopes, elephants, and even hippopotamuses, alongside diverse plant species typical of savanna and woodland biomes. As the global climate shifted toward the Holocene around 11,000 BP, rainfall decreased and evaporation rates rose, leading to the gradual desiccation of the region and the establishment of the semi-arid ecosystem characteristic of the modern Kalahari Desert.\n\n\nGeography\n\nDrainage of the desert is by dry black valleys, seasonally inundated pans, and the large salt pans of the Makgadikgadi Pan in Botswana and Etosha Pan in Namibia. The only permanent river, the Okavango, flows into a delta in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds—called Ouramba—traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.\nA semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the Namib Desert to the west. There is little rainfall, and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive 110–200 mm (4.3–7.9 in) of rain per year, and the wettest just a little over 500 mm (20 in). The surrounding Kalahari Basin covers over 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi) extending farther into Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, encroaching into parts of Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is sub-humid rather than semi-arid in the north and east, where the dry forests, savannahs, and salt lakes prevail. South and west, where the vegetation is predominantly xeric savanna or even a semi-desert, the climate is \"Kalaharian\" semi-arid. The Kalaharian climate is subtropical:  average annual temperature greater than or equal to 18 °C (64 °F), at peaks reaching 40 °C (104 °F) and above, with mean monthly temperature of the coldest month strictly below 18 °C (64 °F), and is semi-arid with the dry season from April to September, the coldest six months of the year. It is the southern tropical equivalent of the Sahelian climate with the wet season during summer. The altitude has been adduced as the explanation why the Kalaharian climate is not tropical; its altitude ranges from 600 to 1600 meters (and generally from 800 to 1200 meters), resulting in a cooler climate than that of the Sahel or Sahara. For example, winter frost is common from June to August, rarely seen in the warmer Sahelian regions. For the same reason, summer temperatures certainly can be very hot, but not in comparison to regions of low altitude in the Sahel or Sahara, where some stations record average temperatures of the warmest month around 38 °C (100 °F), whereas the average temperature of the warmest month in any region in the Kalahari never exceeds 29 °C (84 °F), though daily temperatures occasionally reach up to close to 45 °C (113 °F) (44.8 °C (112.6 °F) at Twee Rivieren Rest Camp in 2012).\n\nThe dry season lasts eight months or more, and the wet season typically from less than one month to four months, depending on location. The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, particularly a small region toward the west-southwest of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual rainfall ranges from around 110 mm (close to aridity) to more than 500 mm in some north and east areas. During summertime in all regions, rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours of sunshine are recorded annually on average.\nIn the Kalahari, there are three main mechanisms of atmospheric circulation, dominated by the Kalahari High anticyclone in winter, and by the Kalahari Heat Low in summer:\n\nThe North and Northwest of the Kalahari are subject to the alternation \"Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)/\"Continental Trade winds\". The ITCZ is the meeting area of the boreal trade winds with their austral counterparts what meteorologists call \"Meteorological equator\" and the sailors \"Doldrum\" or \"Pot-au-noir\" : the ITCZ generates rains in the wet season, whereas the continental trade winds cause the dry season;\nThe rest of the Kalahari is subject to the maritime trade winds that largely shed their moisture as they cross up and over the Southern African Great Escarpment before arriving over the Kalahari.\nIn the southern hemisphere summer (from December to February), a low-pressure system develops over the Kalahari, which is driven by strong surface heating (known as a Thermal Low). The low-pressure system helps to control the moisture-bearing easterly wind emanating from the Indian Ocean, thus influencing rainfall across southern Africa.\nThere are huge subterranean water reserves beneath parts of the Kalahari; the Dragon's Breath Cave, for example, is the largest documented non-subglacial underground lake. Such reserves may partly be the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place. The ancient Lake Makgadikgadi dominated the area, covering the Makgadikgadi Pan and surrounding areas, but it drained or dried out some 10,000 years ago. It may have once covered as much as 120,000 square kilometres (46,000 sq mi). In ancient times, there was sufficient moisture for farming, with dikes and dams collecting the water. These are now filled with sediment, breached, or no longer in use, though they can be readily seen via Google Earth.\nThe Kalahari has had a complex climatic history over the past million or so years, in line with major global changes. Changes in the last 250,000 years have been reconstructed from various data sources, providing evidence of former extensive lakes and drier periods. During the latter, the area of the Kalahari has expanded to include parts of western Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Angola.\n\n\nVegetation and flora\n\nDue to its low aridity, the Kalahari supports a variety of flora. The native flora includes acacia trees and many other herbs and grasses. The kiwano fruit, also known as the horned melon, melano, African horned cucumber, jelly melon, or hedged gourd, is endemic to a region in the Kalahari Desert (specific region unknown).\nEven where the Kalahari \"desert\" is dry enough to qualify as a desert in the sense of having low precipitation, it is not strictly speaking a desert because it has too dense a ground cover. The main region that lacks ground cover is in the southwest Kalahari (southeast of Namibia, northwest of South Africa, and southwest of Botswana) in the south of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. For instance, in the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality of South Africa, total vegetation cover may be as low as 30.72% on non-protected (from cattle grazing) farmlands south of Twee Rivieren Rest Camp and 37.74% in the protected (from cattle grazing) South African side of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park: these southernmost Kalahari xeric savanna areas are truly semi-deserts. However, in all the remaining Kalahari, except on salt pans during the dry season, the vegetation cover can be denser, up to almost 100%, in some limited areas.\nIn an area of about 600,000 km2 in the south and west of the Kalahari, the vegetation is mainly xeric savanna. This area is the ecoregion identified by World Wide Fund for Nature as Kalahari xeric savanna AT1309. Typical savanna grasses include Schmidtia, Stipagrostis, Aristida, and Eragrostis; these are interspersed with trees such as Camelthorn (Vachellia erioloba), Grey Camelthorn (Vachellia haematoxylon), shepherd's tree (Boscia albitrunca), Blackthorn (Senegalia mellifera), and Silver Cluster-Leaf (Terminalia sericea).\nIn certain areas where the climate is drier, it becomes a true semi-desert with ground not entirely covered by vegetation: \"open\" as opposed to \"closed\" vegetation. Examples include the north of the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality, itself in the north of South Africa, and the Keetmanshoop Rural in the southeast of Namibia. In the north and east, dry forests cover an area of over 300,000 km2 in which Rhodesian teak and several species of acacia are prominent. These regions are termed Kalahari Acacia-Baikiaea woodlands AT0709.\nOutside the Kalahari \"desert\", but in the Kalahari basin, halophytic vegetation to the north is adapted to pans, lakes that are completely dry during the dry season, and maybe for years during droughts, such as in Etosha (Etosha Pan halophytics AT0902) and Makgadikgadi (Zambezian halophytics AT0908).\nA totally different vegetation is adapted to the perennial fresh water of the Okavango Delta, an ecoregion termed Zambezian flooded grasslands AT0907.\n\n\nFauna\n\nThe Kalahari is home to the lion (Panthera leo), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), African leopard (Panthera pardus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), brown hyena (Parahyaena brunnea), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus pictus). Birds of prey include the secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus) and other eagles, the giant eagle owl (Bubo lacteus) and other owls, falcons, goshawks, kestrels, and kites. Other animals include wildebeest, springbok, gemsbok and other antelopes, Cape porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis), and ostriches (Struthio camelus).\nSome of the areas within the Kalahari are seasonal wetlands, such as the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. This area, for example, supports numerous halophilic species, and in the rainy season, tens of thousands of flamingos visit these pans.\n\n\nProtected areas\nThe following protected areas were established in the Kalahari:\n\nCentral Kalahari Game Reserve\nKgalagadi Transfrontier Park\nKhutse Game Reserve\nTswalu Kalahari\n\n\nPopulation\n\nThe San people have lived in the Kalahari for 20,000 years as hunter-gatherers. They hunt wild game with bows and poisoned arrows and gather edible plants, such as berries, melons and nuts, as well as insects. The San get most of their water requirements from plant roots and desert melons found on or under the desert floor. They often store water in the blown-out shells of ostrich eggs. The San live in huts built from local materials—the frame is made of branches, and the roof is thatched with long grass. Most of their hunting and gathering techniques replicate those of pre-historic tribes. Bantu-speaking Tswana, Kgalagadi, Herero and a small number of European settlers also live in the Kalahari desert. The city of Windhoek is situated in the Kalahari Basin.\n\n\nKalahari, San and diamonds\n\nIn 1996, De Beers evaluated the potential of diamond mining at Gope. In 1997, the eviction of the San and Bakgalagadi tribes in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve from their land began.\nIn 2006, the High Court of Botswana ruled in favor of the San and Bakgalagadi tribes in the reserve, finding their eviction unlawful. The Government of Botswana granted a permit to De Beers' Gem Diamonds/Gope Exploration Company (Pty) Ltd. to conduct mining activities within the reserve.\n\n\nSettlements within the Kalahari\n\n\nSee also\nKaroo\nKgalagadi (disambiguation)\nThar desert\nSahara\nHot deserts\nClimate change in Namibia\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nMain, Michael (1987).

It lies east of the Pontic–Caspian steppe and west of the Emin Valley steppe, with which it forms the central and western part of the Eurasian steppe. The Kazakh Steppe is an ecoregion of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome in the Palearctic realm. Before the mid-19th century, it was called the Kirghiz steppe, 'Kirghiz' being an old Russian word for the Kazakhs.\n\n\nSetting\nThe steppe extends more than 2,200 km (1,400 mi) from the east of the Caspian Depression and north of the Aral Sea, all the way to the Altai Mountains. It is the largest dry steppe region on earth, covering approximately 804,450 km2 (310,600 sq mi). The Kazakh Steppe lies at the southern end of the Ural Mountains, the traditional dividing line between Europe and Asia. Much of the steppe is considered to be semi-desert, grading into desert as one goes further south. The Turan Lowland lies in  the southwestern part of the steppe, but elevation increases as one travels east or to the northern parts of the steppe, with a few exceptions.\nThe Pontic Steppe lies to the west and northwest. To the north and northeast of the Kazakh Steppe lies the Kazakh forest steppe, an ecoregion of pine groves interspersed with grasslands that forms a transition between the Kazakh steppe and the forests of Siberia. To the south lies the Kazakh semi-desert and the Kazakh upland ecoregions. The Kokshetau Massif in north-central Kazakhstan harbors an enclave of the Kazakh upland, distinct from the Kazakh steppe which surrounds it at lower elevations.\n\n\nClimate\nThe region has a semi-arid, continental climate. Most of the area falls under the cool semi-arid (BSk) classification under the Köppen climate classification system, although the moister north is classed as humid continental (Dfa/Dfb). The steppe receives between 200 and 400 millimetres (8 and 16 in) of precipitation in an average year, with more falling in the northern areas. Average maximum temperatures range from 20 to 26 °C (68.0 to 78.8 °F) in July, and from −12 to −18 °C (10.4 to −0.4 °F) in January. Very high winds sweep across the plains at times.\n\n\nFlora\nBecause of low rainfall, the steppe has few trees, and consists of mostly grasslands and large, sandy areas.  Typical vegetation includes feathergrass (Stipa), wormwood (Artemisia (genus)), and fescue (Festuca). In parts of the steppe, woody plant encroachment is observed.\n\n\nFauna\nAnimals that can be found in the steppes of Kazakhstan include the Saiga antelope, Siberian roe deer, wolves, foxes, badgers, Mongolian gerbils, and steppe tortoises.\n\n\nPeople\n\nThe western part of the Kazakh Steppe is very sparsely populated, with between two and three people per 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi). As one heads east across the plains, the population density increases to between four and seven people per 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi). Kazakh people make up the majority of the people living in the area.

{"eco_id": 313, "eco_name": "Kinabalu montane alpine meadows", "wiki_title": "Mount Kinabalu", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kinabalu", "extract_text": "Mount Kinabalu (Dusun: Gayo Ngaran or Nulu Nabalu, Malay: Gunung Kinabalu) is the highest mountain in Malaysia and Maritime Southeast Asia, located on the island of Borneo in Sabah. With a height of 4,095 metres (13,435 ft), it is the third-highest peak of an island on Earth, the 28th highest peak in Southeast Asia, and 20th most prominent mountain in the world. The mountain is located in Ranau district, West Coast Division of Sabah, Malaysia. It is protected as Kinabalu Park, a World Heritage Site.\n\nIn 1997, a re-survey using satellite technology was conducted. It established Mount Kinabalu had a summit (known as Low's Peak) height of 4,095 m (13,435 ft) above sea level, some 6 m (20 ft) less than the hitherto published figure of 4,101 m (13,455 ft).\nThe mountain and its surroundings have exceptional biodiversity, with 5,000 to 6,000 species of plants, 326 species of birds, and over 100 mammalian species identified. Among this rich collection of wildlife are famous species such as the Rafflesia plants and orangutans.\n\nLow's Peak can be climbed by a person in good physical condition without mountaineering equipment on the main route. However, climbers must be accompanied by accredited guides at all times due to national park regulations and the risk of experiencing altitude sickness.\n\n\nGeology\nMount Kinabalu is a massive pluton formed from granodiorite which is intrusive into sedimentary and ultrabasic rocks, and forms the central part, or core, of the Kinabalu massif. The granodiorite is intrusive into strongly folded strata, probably of Eocene to Miocene age, and associated ultrabasic and basic igneous rocks. It was pushed up from the Earth's crust as molten rock millions of years ago. In geological terms, it is a very young mountain as the granodiorite cooled and hardened only about 10 million years ago.\nThe present landform is considered to be a mid-Pliocene peneplain, arched and deeply dissected, through which the Kinabalu granodiorite body has risen in isostatic adjustment. It is still gaining roughly 5 mm (0.20 in) of height per annum.\n\nDuring the Pleistocene Epoch of about 100,000 years ago, the mountain was covered by sheets of ice and glaciers. As these glaciers flowed down its slopes, they scoured the surface of Mount Kinabalu in the process and creating the 1,800 m (5,906 ft) deep Low's Gully (named after Hugh Low) on its north side. Its granitic composition and the glacial formative processes are readily apparent when viewing its craggy rocky peaks.\n\n\nIUGS geological heritage site\nIn respect of it being 'one of the youngest granitic intrusions exposed on Earth and the site of spectacular tropical glacial landscapes', the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the 'Mount Kinabalu Neogene granite' in its assemblage of 100 'geological heritage sites' around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as 'a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.'\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of the mountain varies from humid tropical at its base to alpine at its summit. The temperature at the summit of Mount Kinabalu ranges from −4 to 8 °C (25 to 46 °F) from December to January, and 3 to 12 °C (37 to 54 °F) from June to September. Depending on how cold the mountain remains from December to January, there are a few occasions where frost and ice appear at the summit of Mount Kinabalu. Snow has been recorded three times in this area; in 1975, 1993 and 2022.\n\n\nBiology\nMount Kinabalu, along with other upland areas of the Crocker Mountains, is known worldwide for its biodiversity with plants of Himalayan, Australasian, and Indomalayan origin. A recent botanical survey of the mountain estimated a staggering 5,000 to 6,000 plant species (excluding mosses and liverwort but including ferns) thrive upon the mountain. It is therefore one of the world's most important biological sites. A reason for its rich diversity and endemisms is that its extreme height provides refuge to cold-adapted species during interglacials.\nIn 2015, a major Malaysian-Dutch study showed that the unique flora, fauna, and fungi on the mountain summit are younger than the mountain itself, and have evolved from both local and distant montane ancestors.\n\n\nFlora\nThe flora of the mountain varies with elevation and geology. Lowland forest extends up to about 1,500 metres (4,921 ft) elevation, and consists of two main types, based on the dominant tree species – mixed dipterocarp forest and mixed Casuarina forest. Lowland forests generally have a closed canopy 40 meters tall (131 ft), along with an understory stratum of lower trees, and an emergent stratum of taller trees which extend above the canopy.\nMontane rain forest, also known as cloud forest, extends from approximately 1,400 metres elevation up to 2,900 metres (4,593 to 9,514 ft). Montane forest typically has a closed canopy with single stratum, and the canopy height generally decreases with elevation. Typical trees include species of the plant families Fagaceae and Lauraceae, with conifers increasingly abundant at higher elevations. The lower montane forests have a high diversity of orchid and fern species. Carnivorous plants, including species of Nepenthes, Drosera, and Utricularia, are most diverse between 2,200 and 2,550 meters elevation, in areas with high rainfall and a stunted, open tree canopy. The montane forests are interspersed with areas of graminoid scrub, generally associated with hypermagnesic cambisol soils.\nSub-alpine scrub extends from 2,600 to 3,200 m (8,530 to 10,499 ft). It includes short trees and shrubs such the conifer Dacrydium gibbsiae, Leptospermum recurvum, and species from the plant families Myrtaceae and Ericaceae, along with dwarf shrubs, mosses, lichens, liverworts, and ferns. Orchids are abundant and diverse in subalpine and alpine plant communities, except at the highest summits. Above 3,500 meters conditions are too extreme for trees, and above 3,700 meters persistent ground frost limits plants to the hardiest grasses, sedges and dwarf shrubs, including Leptospermum recurvatum and Rhododendron ericoides, which grow in crevices and other sheltered areas on the rocky summits.\n\nThe plants of Mount Kinabalu have high levels of biodiversity and endemism (i.e. species which are found only within Kinabalu Park and are not found anywhere else in the world). Orchids are the best-known example, with 866 species in 134 genera, including species of Bulbophyllum, Dendrobium, Coelogyne, Liparis, and Calanthe, and some of the highly valued Paphiopedilum slipper orchids. There are also over 600 species of ferns (more than the whole of Africa's 500 species) of which 50 are found nowhere else. Mount Kinabalu has the richest collection in the world of Nepenthes pitcher plants (five of the thirteen are found nowhere else on earth), some of which reach spectacular proportions (the largest-pitchered in the world being the endemic Nepenthes rajah). The parasitic Rafflesia plant, which has the largest single flower in the world, is also found in Kinabalu (particularly Rafflesia keithii whose flower grows to 94 cm (37 in) in diameter), though blooms of the flower are rare and difficult to find. Meanwhile, another Rafflesia species, Rafflesia tengku-adlinii, can be found on the neighbouring Mount Trus Madi and the nearby Maliau Basin.\nMount Kinabalu's above-average biodiversity in plant life is due to a combination of several unique factors: its setting in one of the richest plant regions of the world (the tropical biogeographical region known as western Malesia which comprises the island of Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and the island of Borneo), the fact that the mountain covers a wide climatic range from near sea level to freezing ground conditions near the summit, the jagged terrain and diversity of rocks and soils, the high levels of rainfall (averaging about 2,700 mm (110 in) a year at park HQ), and the climatic instability caused by periods of glaciation and catastrophic droughts which result in evolution and speciation. This diversity is greatest in the lowland regions (consisting of lowland dipterocarp forests, so called because the tree family Dipterocarpaceae are dominant). However, most of Kinabalu's endemic species are found in the mountain forests, particularly on ultramafic soils.\nThe ultramafic rocks which make up parts of the mountain create soils rich in certain metallic elements (nickel, cobalt, chromium, and manganese), high cation imbalances (high Mg:Ca molar quotients), and deficiencies of some nutrients including potassium and phosphorus. These soil conditions affect the plant life, and plant communities on ultramafic soils show lower stature and lower biomass, higher levels of endemism, and a distinct species composition compared to plant communities at similar elevations elsewhere on the mountain.\n\n\nFauna\n\nThe variety of plant life is also habitat for a great variety of birds and mammals. There are some 326 species of birds in Kinabalu Park, including the spectacular rhinoceros hornbill, mountain serpent-eagle, Dulit frogmouth, eyebrowed jungle flycatcher, and bare-headed laughingthrush. Twenty-four birds are mainly found on the mountain. Four species – the Borneo thrush (Turdus poliocephalus seebohmi), mountain blackeye (Zosterops emiliae), friendly bush warbler (Locustella accentor), and aberrant bush warbler (Horornis flavolivaceus) – are native to the subalpine zone.\nThe mountain is home to some 100 mammalian species mostly living high in the trees, including one of the great apes, the Bornean orangutan (though sightings of these are uncommon; estimates of its numbers in the park range from 25 to 120). Other mammals include three kinds of deer, the Malayan weasel (Mustela nudipes), Oriental small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea), and leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). Endemic mammals include the black shrew (Suncus ater). However, others of its endemics, such as the Bornean ferret-badger (Melogale everetti) and Rattus baluensis, have also recently been recorded in the nearby Mount Tambuyukon.\nEndemic annelids number less than a dozen known species but include the Kinabalu giant red leech that preys on various earthworms, including the Kinabalu giant earthworm. In the summit zone, at least 26 endemic species of land snail exist. In 2012, a major scientific expedition, jointly organised by the Malaysian Sabah Parks and the Dutch Naturalis Biodiversity Center, performed DNA analysis of several dozen endemic flora, fauna, and fungi, to understand the evolutionary origin of the unique biodiversity of Kinabalu.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\n\nThe steep mountainsides with poor soil are not suitable for farming or for the timber industry so the habitats and animal life of Kinabalu remain largely intact, with about a third of the original habitat now degraded. Kinabalu Park was established in 1964 and the nearby mountains were protected as the Crocker Range National Park in 1984. However even national park status does not guarantee full protection, as logging permits were granted on Trus Madi in 1984.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBritish colonial administrator Hugh Low made the first recorded ascent of Mount Kinabalu's summit plateau in March 1851 with local Dusun guide Lemaing of Kampung Kiau. Low did not scale the mountain's highest peak, however, considering it \"inaccessible to any but winged animals\". In April and July 1858, Low was accompanied on two further ascents by Spenser St. John, the British Consul in Brunei. The highest point of Mount Kinabalu was finally reached in 1888 by zoologist John Whitehead. British botanist Lilian Gibbs became the first woman and the first botanist to summit Mount Kinabalu in February 1910.\nBotanist E. J. H. Corner led two important expeditions of the Royal Society of Great Britain to the mountain in 1961 and 1964. Kinabalu National Park was established in 1964. The park was designated a natural World Heritage Site in 2000.\n\n\n2015 earthquake\n\nOn 5 June 2015 at 07:15 MST, the area around Mount Kinabalu was damaged by an earthquake. Eighteen people, including hikers and mountain guides, were killed by the earthquake and a massive landslide that followed it. Ranau and many parts of Sabah West Coast were affected and Donkey Ear's Peak was heavily damaged.\nSix days before the earthquake, a group of ten western tourists (comprising six men and four women from Canada, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom) had stripped naked and urinated while on the mountain's summit. Local people were deeply offended, and many who considered Kinabalu to be a sacred place believed that the act had angered the mountain spirits. Four of the group were convicted on charges of public indecency, and sentenced to three days in jail and a fine of 5,000 ringgit.\nFollowing the incident, some of the tourists and their families expressed their apologies to all involved parties, and the government of the United Kingdom began to review its travel advice for Malaysia.\n\n\nClimbing the mountain\n\nClimbers must be accompanied by accredited guides at all times due to national park regulations. There are two main starting points for the climb: the Timpohon Gate (located 5.5 km (3.4 mi) from Kinabalu Park Headquarters, at an altitude of 1,866 m (6,122 ft)), and the Mesilau Nature Resort. The latter starting point is slightly higher in elevation, but crosses a ridge, adding about two kilometres to the ascent and making the total elevation gain slightly higher. The Mesilau Trail is no longer accessible due to the earthquake in 2015. The two trails meet about 2 km (1.2 mi) before Laban Rata.\nSabah Parks grants a summit-climbing permit only to climbers who stay at mountain huts. Due to the limited number of beds at the mountain huts, only 130 people are allowed to climb Mount Kinabalu per day.\nAccommodation is available inside the park or outside near the headquarters. Sabah Parks has privatised Mount Kinabalu activities to an organisation called Sutera Sanctuary Lodges. The mountain may be climbed on a single day trip, or hikers may (usually) stay one night at Laban Rata Resthouse at 3,270 m (10,730 ft) to complete the climb in 2 days, finishing the ascent and descending on the second day. The majority of climbers begin the ascent on day one of a two-day hike from Timpohon gate at 1,866 m (6,122 ft), reaching this location either by minibus or by walking, and then walk to Laban Rata. Most people accomplish this part of the climb in 3 to 6 hours. Since there are no roads, the supplies for the Laban Rata Resthouse are carried by porters, who sometimes bring more than 35 kg (77 lb) of supplies on their backs. Hot food and beverages are available at Laban Rata. Most rooms have no hot water in the bathrooms and whilst the dining area is heated, most rooms are not. The last 2 km (6,600 ft), from the Laban Rata Resthouse at 3,270 m (10,730 ft) to Low's Peak (summit) at 4,095.2 m (13,436 ft), takes between 2 and 4 hours. The last part of the climb is on bare granite rock.\nGiven the high altitude, some people may suffer from altitude sickness although staying overnight at the lodges before the climb and climbing at a lower rate of ascent may reduce the likelihood of this happening.\nSince 1987 skyrunning competition Mount Kinabalu Climbathon has been held here (went international in 1988).\n\n\nLow's Gully\nLow's Gully (named after Hugh Low who first looked down into it in 1851) is a 1,800 m (5,906 ft) deep gorge carved out by glaciation on the north side of Mount Kinabalu, which is exceptionally inhospitable due to its depth and high rainfall. In March 1994 two British Army officers were severely criticised after leading a party of 7 British and 3 Hong Kong soldiers in an attempt to abseil and climb down into the gully that required extensive rescue efforts from both the RAF and the Malaysian army. The party were not equipped with radios and the 2 officers and 3 Hong Kong soldiers were trapped for 16 days and did not eat for five days before being rescued when stretchers were lowered by helicopter. The breakaway party of five completed the first descent of the gully in three days. A book about the 31-day fight for survival entitled Descent into Chaos was published in 1996 and a film drama The Place of the Dead was released in 1997. The first successful complete descent of Low's Gully was achieved by a 27 strong joint Malaysian-British team led by mountaineer and former British Army officer Pat Gunson in 1998.\n\n\nMeaning of name\n\nThere are several explanations for the mountain's name. The word Kinabalu is likely simply a clipping of Aki Nabalu (Grandfather Nabalu), the guardian spirit of the mountain. The Liwan tribe of the Kadazandusun people refer to the mountain by the name Gayo Ngaran (lit. \"The Great Name\") instead. Additionally, yearly pilgrimages taken by the Kadazandusun to the mountain is referred to as Kakakapan id Gayo Ngaran (lit. \"Visiting the Great Name\").\nA disputed folk etymology that the name \"Kinabalu\" actually means \"Cina Balu\" (meaning \"A Chinese Widow\" in Malay).  However, this folk story is debated, as it is interpreting the Kadazandusun phrase as if it were Malay. In Kadazandusun, Kina or Sina means 'Chinese', but 'widow' in Kadazandusun is nopuod, not balu; with the root puod being a verb meaning 'to become widowed'. An earlier book by Spenser St. John published in 1863 claimed that \"Kina Balu\" means \"Chinese widow\".\n\n\nSee also\nBorneo lowland rain forest – ecoregion\nBorneo montane rain forests – ecoregion\nList of ultras of the Malay Archipelago\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n Mount Kinabalu travel guide from Wikivoyage\nSabah Parks website\nSabah's Fitus species\nThe Sensei, Reel Rock episode about 2012 climbing project by Yuji Hirayama (Part I, Part II)\nList of climbers who have hiked Mount Kinabalu", "revid": 1327039074, "rev_timestamp": "2025-12-12T06:57:40Z", "source": "enwiki"}
{"eco_id": 357, "eco_name": "Klamath-Siskiyou forests", "wiki_title": "Klamath Mountains (ecoregion)", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klamath_Mountains_(ecoregion)", "extract_text": "The Klamath Mountains ecoregion  of Oregon and California lies inland and north of the Coast Range ecoregion, extending from the Umpqua River in the north to the Sacramento Valley in the south. It encompasses the highly dissected ridges, foothills, and valleys of the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains. It corresponds to the Level III ecoregion designated by the Environmental Protection Agency and to the Klamath-Siskiyou forests ecoregion designated by the World Wide Fund for Nature.\nThe ecoregion is also a geomorphic province and was unglaciated during the Pleistocene epoch, when it served as a refuge for northern plant species. Its mix of granitic, sedimentary, metamorphic, and extrusive rocks contrasts with the predominantly volcanic rocks of the Cascades ecoregion to the northeast. The mild, subhumid climate of the region is characterized by a lengthy summer drought. It supports a mosaic of both northern Californian and Pacific Northwestern conifers and hardwoods.\n\n\nEcology\n\n\nFlora\nThe ecoregion harbors rich biodiversity, with several distinct plant communities, including temperate rain forests, moist inland forests, oak forests and savannas, high elevation forests, and alpine grasslands. Thirty conifer species inhabit the region, including seven endemic species, making the region one of the richest coniferous forest regions of the world in species diversity. The region also has several edaphic plant communities (adapted to specific soil types), notably those of the region's serpentine outcrops.\nTemperate rain forests grow near the coast and are dominated by the conifers coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Grand fir, coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Lawson's cypress (also known as Port Orford Cedar, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) and broadleaf Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple, Pacific rhododendron, California laurel, and tanoak.\nInland forests are dominated by Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), Coast Douglas-fir, white fir (Abies concolor subsp. lowiana), red fir (A. magnifica subsp. shastensis), California incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), Knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata), Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and Oregon white oak, California black oak, tanoak and Pacific madrone. Areas with serpentine soil are dominated by Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), Knobcone pine (P. attenuata), Lodgepole pine (P. contorta) and various shrubs. Oak savanna and small patches of chaparral also occur. Oak savannas are dominated by Oregon white oak, California black oak, and chaparral is dominated by manzanita, ceanothus, deer brush and marks the northern extent of the range for California Buckeye.\nHigh elevation forests are dominated by Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine, western juniper, Mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), white fir, red fir, Pacific silver fir, Weeping spruce (Picea breweriana) and foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana).\nSeveral species and subspecies of plants are endemic to the ecoregion. Endemic plants which grow on serpentine soils including McDonald's rock cress (Arabis mcdonaldiana), Koehler's rock cress (Boechera koehleri), Klamath manzanita (Arctostaphylos klamathensis), Calochortus howellii, Calochortus umpquaensis, Castilleja elata, Shasta chaenactis (Chaenactis suffrutescens), Siskiyou fireweed (Epilobium siskiyouense), serpentine goldenbush (Ericameria ophitidis), Trinity buckwheat (Eriogonum alpinum), Congdon's buckwheat (Eriogonum congdonii), Klamath Mountain buckwheat (Eriogonum hirtellum), Dubakella Mountain buckwheat (Eriogonum libertini), Erythronium citrinum, Galium serpenticum subsp. scotticum, Gentiana setigera, Niles' harmonia (Harmonia doris-nilesiae), Hastingsia atropurpurea, Lomatium engelmannii, Heller's Mount Eddy lupine (Lupinus lapidicola), Kneeland Prairie pennycress (Noccaea fendleri subsp. californica), thread-leaved beardtongue (Penstemon filiformis), Perideridia erythrorhiza, Scott Valley phacelia (Phacelia greenei), Phacelia dalesiana, Siskiyou phacelia (Phacelia leonis), Yreka phlox (Phlox hirsuta), crested potentilla (Potentilla cristae), Potentilla pickeringii, showy raillardella (Raillardella pringlei), peanut sandwort (Sabulina rosei), Sedum moranii, salmon-flowered catchfly (Silene salmonacea), serpentine catchfly (Silene serpentinicola), and western white bog violet (Viola primulifolia var. occidentalis). Other endemic species include the Del Norte willow (Salix delnortensis) and Brewer spruce (Picea breweriana).\n\n\nLevel IV ecoregions\n\nThe ecoregion has been subdivided into Level IV ecoregions, as described below.\n\n\nRogue/Illinois Valleys (78a)\nThe Rogue/Illinois Valleys ecoregion includes terraces and floodplains in the Rogue and Illinois river valleys at an elevation of 900 to 2,000 feet (274 to 610 m). Historically, the valleys supported Oregon white oak and California black oak woodland, with Pacific madrone, Ponderosa pine, and grassland. Common understory plants included California fescue, snowberry, and serviceberry. Riparian areas supported willow and cottonwood. Much of the land has been developed for agricultural or residential use, and little of the original vegetation remains. Remnants of oak savanna, prairie vegetation, and seasonal ponds persist on the mesa tops of the Table Rocks north of Medford. Elsewhere, land uses include orchards, cropland, and pastureland. Climate, vegetation, and resulting land use are more similar to Northern California’s inland valleys than to the Willamette Valley ecoregion to the north. The region covers 285 square miles (738 km2) in Oregon, in three separate areas around Medford and Ashland, Grants Pass, and Cave Junction.\n\n\nOak Savanna Foothills (78b)\nThe Oak Savanna Foothills ecoregion consists of moderately sloping mountain foothills bordering the Rogue and Illinois river valleys and sharing their Mediterranean climate. Elevation varies from 1,400 to 4,000 feet (427 to 1,219 m). The driest area, east of Medford, is dominated by Oregon white oak and California black oak woodlands, grassland-savanna, ponderosa pine, and Coast Douglas-fir. The wetter foothills flanking the Illinois Valley support Coast douglas-fir, pacific madrone, and California incense-cedar. Understory species include oceanspray, Western poison-oak, snowberry, Idaho fescue, California brome, roughstalk bluegrass, and ceanothus. The region is lower and less dissected, with more oak woodland and less closed-canopied forest than the Inland Siskiyous. It covers 818 square miles (2,119 km2) in Oregon.\n\n\nUmpqua Interior Foothills (78c)\nThe Umpqua Interior Foothills ecoregion is a complex of foothills and narrow valleys containing fluvial terraces and\nfloodplains. Elevation varies from 400 to 2,800 feet (122 to 853 m). It is drier than the foothills of the Willamette Valley, partly because the summer Pacific high pressure system arrives earlier and remains longer than in ecoregions to the north. Summers are hot and dry, and soils have a xeric moisture regime in contrast to the udic soils of the Mid-Coastal Sedimentary ecoregion to the west. The slopes are covered by Oregon white oak woodland, Coast douglas-fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, pacific madrone, tanoak, and chinquapin, with an understory chaparral community that includes snowberry, salal, Oregon grape, poison oak, oceanspray, and swordfern. Many areas have been converted to pastureland, vineyards, orchards, and row crops. It covers 921 square miles (2,385 km2) in Oregon in the Umpqua Valley, including the city of Roseburg.\n\n\nSerpentine Siskiyous (78d)\nThe Serpentine Siskiyous ecoregion consists of highly dissected mountains containing perennial, high gradient streams at an elevation of 1,500 to 4,300 feet (457 to 1,311 m). It is lithogically distinct from the rest of the Klamath Mountains ecoregion. Many plants have difficulty growing in its serpentine soils due to a shortage of calcium and high levels of magnesium, nickel, and chromium. As a result, vegetation is often sparse and composed of specialist species that have evolved to grow in the potentially toxic and nutrient-poor serpentine soils. It supports a mixed conifer forest of Jeffrey pine, tanoak, california incense-cedar, Coast douglas-fir, and montane chaparral composed of manzanita, ceanothus, Idaho fescue, and Lemmon needlegrass. Historic gold, nickel, chromite, copper, and mercury mining have contributed to water quality problems. The region covers 440 square miles (1,140 km2) in Oregon, including portions of the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis and Wild Rogue wildernesses.\n\n\nInland Siskiyous (78e)\n\nThe Inland Siskiyous ecoregion is higher and more mountainous than the neighboring foothill and valley ecoregions, with an elevation of 800 to 7,000 feet (244 to 2,134 m). It has a higher fire frequency, less annual precipitation, and longer summer droughts than the Coastal Siskiyous. Forest cover is a diverse and multi-layered mix of conifers, broadleaf evergreens, and deciduous trees and shrubs, featuring coast douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, sugar pine, Oregon white oak, California black oak, Pacific madrone, serviceberry, snowberry, Oregon grape, California fescue, and Pacific poison oak. The largest of the Klamath Mountains subregions mapped so far, it covers 2,610 square miles (6,760 km2) in Oregon, including public lands within the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest.\n\n\nCoastal Siskiyous (78f)\nThe Coastal Siskiyous ecoregion consists of highly dissected mountains with a wetter and milder maritime climate than elsewhere in the Klamath Mountains ecoregion. Elevation varies from 600 to 5,300 feet (183 to 1,615 m). Productive forests composed of Tanoak, Coast douglas-fir, Coast redwood, bigleaf maple, California laurel, and some Port Orford cedar and Nootka cypress cover its mountainous landscape, with chinqupin, salal, pacific rhododendron, and western swordfern; tanoak is more common than elsewhere in Oregon. Broadleaf evergreens, such as tanoak and pacific madrone, quickly colonize disturbed areas, making it difficult to regenerate conifer forest growth. Xeric soils derived from Siskiyou rock types are characteristic; udic soils which support western hemlock, Sitka spruce and Western red cedar are present but are less common than in the wetter Coast Range ecoregion to the west. The region covers 853 square miles (2,209 km2) in Oregon, including portions of the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Kalmiopsis and Wild Rogue Wilderness wildernesses.\n\n\nKlamath River Ridges (78g)\nThe Klamath River Ridges is characterized by highly dissected mountains, with a dry, continental climate. Elevation varies from 3,800 to 7,500 feet (1,158 to 2,286 m). Vegetation varies with slope, aspect, and elevation. Higher elevations and north-facing slopes have Coast douglas-fir, white fir and red fir; lower elevations and south-facing slopes are covered in ponderosa pine and western juniper, species that are more drought-resistant than other vegetation types found within the region. The chaparral features Oregon grape, western fescue, snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, and ceanothus. The region covers 121 square miles (313 km2) in Oregon near the Siskiyou Summit, including portions of the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest and the Cascade–Siskiyou National Monument.\n\n\nBorder High-Siskiyous (78h)\nThe Border High-Siskiyous ecoregion consists of relatively high elevation mountains along the border area of Oregon and California. Elevations range from about 5,000 to 7,000 feet (1,500 to 2,100 m), with a high point of 7,533 feet (2,296 m) at Mount Ashland, Oregon. White fir and Red fir forests occur, with some Jeffrey pine on ultramafic rocks, and a few areas of\nsubalpine habitats. With a large western to eastern extent, conditions are slightly drier to the east.\n\n\nWestern Klamath Low Elevation Forests (78i)\nThe Western Klamath Low Elevation Forests ecoregion is at elevations generally less than 3,500 feet (1,100 m). Douglas-fir and Port Orford cedar occur on lower slopes, grading into Douglas-fir and tanoak, or higher areas with canyon live oak. Red and white alder are typical along streams. Mixed oak stands occur on drier sites. The ecoregion generally is wetter and has a somewhat denser forest landscape than the drier Ecoregion 78k to the east.\n\n\nWestern Klamath Montane Forests (78j)\nThe Western Klamath Montane Forests ecoregion generally is higher than Ecoregion 78i, with elevations typically ranging from 3,500 to 6,900 feet (1,100 to 2,100 m). Annual temperatures are cooler than in Ecoregion 78i, and precipitation is greater. The vegetation consists mostly of Douglas-fir and white fir forests, with some red fir forests at high elevations. Ecoregion 78j lacks the serpentine geology of nearby Ecoregion 78d, and is composed mostly of Mesozoic quartz diorite, with areas of Jurassic slate, graywacke, shale, and sandstone.\n\n\nEastern Klamath Low Elevation Forests (78k)\nThe Eastern Klamath Low Elevation Forests ecoregion is geologically and botanically diverse, and has some drier forests than ecoregion 78i to the west. Elevations generally are less than 3,500 feet (1,100 m). Forest and woodland types can include areas of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, canyon live oak, and knobcone pine, along with chaparral of chamise, deer brush, and manzanita. Along streams, cottonwoods, white alder, and willows occur.\n\n\nEastern Klamath Montane Forests (78l)\nTypically at elevations greater than 4,000 feet (1,200 m), the Eastern Klamath Montane Forests ecoregion includes a mosaic of forest and chaparral types. It often has more open tree canopies and understories than western Klamath regions. White fir, incense cedar, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and sugar pine are dominant, with mountain dogwood in the understory. Some minor areas of Shasta fir or red fir occur at high elevations. Black and canyon live oaks mix with scattered conifers on drier sites, with understories of huckleberry oak and other chaparral species.\n\n\nMarble/Salmon Mountains-Trinity Alps (78m)\nThe Marble/Salmon Mountains-Trinity Alps ecoregion includes the Salmon Mountains, Marble Mountains, and Trinity Alps in the montane elevations from 3,500 to 7,000 ft (1,100 to 2,100 m). The rugged region has steep slopes and numerous canyons and narrow mountain valleys. Granitic, metavolcanic, and metasedimentary rocks occur, including some areas of serpentinized peridotite. The climate is colder than surrounding lower elevation ecoregions 78g, 78i, and 78k. Forests include Douglas-fir, white fir, and at high elevations, red fir.\n\n\nScott Mountains (78n)\nThe Scott Mountains ecoregion is dominated by ultramafic rocks with Mesozoic mafic intrusions, along with some granitic rocks near the Trinity Alps and at Castle Crags. Elevations generally range from 3,000 to 7,000 ft (910 to 2,130 m). Ecoregion 78n has more ultramaficrocks and less precipitation than Ecoregion 78m to the west. Vegetation includes Jeffrey pine, mixed conifer, and white fir. The ecoregion drains to the Trinity, Sacramento, Scott, and Shasta Rivers.\n\n\nKlamath Subalpine (78o)\nThe Klamath Subalpine ecoregion is higher, wetter, and colder than surrounding areas, with elevations generally greater than 6,800 feet (2,100 m). Most of the region was glaciated, shown by the numerous cirques, moraines, and other glacial features. Shasta red fir, mountain hemlock, and some western white pine occur, as well as subalpine meadows with various mixes of shrubs, herbs, and grasses. Some foxtail pine occurs as well as small areas of Pacific silver fir to the north. Soils tend to be thin and rocky, across various bedrock types including granitics, gabbro, and ultramafic rocks. Soils deepen downslope.\n\n\nDuzel Rock (78p)\nThe Duzel Rock ecoregion is slightly lower in elevation with less relief than Klamath Mountain ecoregions immediately north or south, and it has more juniper and big sagebrush, along with scattered woodland. Ponderosa pine, Oregon white oak, and areas of Jeffrey pine occur. Some Douglas-fir is found at higher elevations and on northern slopes. Curl-leaf mountain mahogany is common in the western and southern parts. The geology is mostly Cambrian through Devonian metasedimentary and minor metavolcanic rocks including metamorphosed conglomerate, sandstone, shale, chert, limestone, and basalt. The region drains to the Scott and Shasta Rivers.\n\n\nSee also\nEcoregions defined by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation:\nList of ecoregions in North America (CEC)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (EPA)\nList of ecoregions in Oregon\nList of ecoregions in California\nThe conservation group World Wildlife Fund maintains an alternate classification system:\nList of ecoregions (WWF)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nA Celebration of the Conifer Diversity in Northwest California\nConifers of Northwest California\nKlamath-Siskiyou Forests images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu (slow modem version)\nCNPS: Rare and Endemic Conifers of Northwest California Archived 2010-09-19 at the Wayback Machine", "revid": 1309181760, "rev_timestamp": "2025-09-02T15:35:25Z", "source": "enwiki"}

It covers an area of 17,800 square kilometers (6,900 sq mi) in South Africa's Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. \n\n\nLimits\nThe Kwazulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic occupies the humid coastal strip between the Indian Ocean and the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains. It is part of a strip of moist coastal forests that extend along Africa's Indian Ocean coast from southern Somalia to South Africa. The northern limit of the ecoregion is at the St. Lucia estuary in KwaZulu Natal, where the forests transition to the Maputaland coastal forest mosaic. The southern limit is at Cape St. Francis, east of Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape Province, where the KwaZulu-Cape forests transition to the Albany thickets.\n\n\nClimate\nThe ecoregion has a seasonally-moist subtropical climate. Rainfall ranges from 1500 mm to 900 mm per year. The northern portion is generally receives more rainfall, typically in the summer months, while the southern portion receives most of its rainfall in the winter months, which is typical of the Mediterranean climate region to the west. Rainfall diminishes away from the coast, and the coastal forest mosaic yields to the drier Maputaland-Pondoland bushland and thickets in the Drakensberg foothills, above 300 to 450 meters elevation.\n\n\nFlora\nThe ecoregion comprises a mosaic of different plant communities, including coastal belt forest, sand forest, dune forest, short, dry forests known as Alexandria forest, grasslands, palm woodlands, and thorn scrublands. Forests are typically made up of evergreen trees, interspersed with dry-season semi-deciduous and deciduous trees.\nEndemics include Rhynchocalyx.\n\n\nProtected areas\nApproximately 9% of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

It is one of the driest regions in the country.\nHuman settlements are mainly near water supplies such as rivers or oases.\nDeforestation and over-grazing around these settlements have caused desertification.\n\n\nLocation\nThe Argentine Monte is in north-central Argentina, and has an area of 354,192 square kilometres (136,800 mi2).\nIt is to the east of the Andes and extends from Salta Province in the north to Chubut Province in the south.\nIt extends from the eastern foothills of the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean. The ecoregion merges into the Patagonian steppe in the south and southwest. The Dry Chaco lies to the northeast, and the Espinal is to the east. \nIn the northwest it borders the High Monte.

It covers an area of 29,961 square kilometres (11,568 sq mi) in southern Mozambique, Eswatini, and the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. Mozambique's capital Maputo lies within the ecoregion. \n\n\nGeography\nThe Maputaland coastal forest mosaic occupies the humid coastal strip along the Indian Ocean, inland to the Lebombo Mountains for much of its length. This is part of a strip of moist coastal forests that extend along Africa's Indian Ocean coast from southern Somalia to South Africa. The northern limit of the ecoregion is north of the mouth of the Limpopo River, near Xai-Xai in Mozambique, where the forests transition to the Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic. The southern limit is near the St Lucia estuary in KwaZulu-Natal, where the Maputaland forests transition to the Kwazulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic.\n\n\nClimate\nThe ecoregion has a seasonally moist, tropical to subtropical climate. Rainfall ranges from 1000 mm per year near the coast to less than 600 mm per year inland. Most of the rain falls in the summer months. The coastal strip includes areas of wetland, the largest of which is Lake St. Lucia, the largest estuarine system in Africa.\n\n\nFlora\nThe ecoregion comprises a mosaic of many different plant communities, from the forest of the Lemombo Mountains through savanna, woodland, palm veld, grassland, sand dunes with patches of dense sand forest, and wetland habitats. The flora of the region includes a number of endemic species.\n\n\nFauna\nThe 100 species of mammal found here include the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), now contained in reserves along the coast, and large predators, of which leopard (Panthera pardus) are the most common. More than 470 bird species are found here, of which 4 are endemic and 43 near-endemic.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nThe South African portion of this region is under threat of change due to increasing population and the introduction of foreign plant species such as the shrub Chromolaena odorata, Australian acacias, guava (Psidium guajava), pines and eucalyptus. In Mozambique this coast is not so heavily populated but the area is affected by forestry and other projects including the Pongolapoort Dam and irrigation schemes.\nAccording to the World Wide Fund for Nature, 14% of the ecoregion is protected in reserves. Protected areas in the ecoregion include iSimangaliso Wetland Park (formerly Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park – 3,280 km2) in KwaZulu-Natal, and Maputo Special Reserve (900 km2) in Mozambique, which has lost most of its large mammals and is being increasingly settled. There are plans to link the Maputo Reserve with Tembe Elephant Park of South Africa in the large cross-border Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area, which would allow elephants to roam more freely. There is little game left along this coast outside of the reserves.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Maputaland Coastal Forests and Woodlands Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons\n\"Maputaland coastal forest mosaic\".

{"eco_id": 20, "eco_name": "Mascarene forests", "wiki_title": "Mascarene Islands", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene_Islands", "extract_text": "The Mascarene Islands (English: ; French: Mascareignes [maskaʁɛɲ] ) or Mascarenes or Mascarenhas Archipelago is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar consisting of islands belonging to the Republic of Mauritius as well as the French department of Réunion. Their name derives from the Portuguese navigator Pedro Mascarenhas, who first visited them in April 1512. The islands share a common geological origin beneath the Mascarene Plateau known as the Mauritia microcontinent which was a Precambrian microcontinent situated between India and Madagascar until their separation about 70 million years ago. They form a distinct ecoregion with unique biodiversity and endemism of flora and fauna.\n\n\nGeography\nThe archipelago comprises three large islands, Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues, plus a number of volcanic remnants in the tropics of the southwestern Indian Ocean, generally between 700 and 1,500 kilometres east of Madagascar. The terrain includes a variety of reefs, atolls, and small islands. They present various topographical and edaphic regions. On the largest islands these gave rise to endemism and unusual biodiversity. The climate is oceanic and tropical.\nMauritius is located 900 km east of Madagascar. It has an area of 1,865 km2. The highest point is 828 meters above sea level. Mauritius is the most populous of the Mascarene Islands, with a population of 1,252,964.\nRéunion is located 150 km southwest of Mauritius. It is the largest of the islands, with an area of 2,512 km2. Piton des Neiges (3,069 m), an extinct volcano, is the highest peak on Réunion and in the islands. Piton de la Fournaise is an active volcano on Réunion which erupts frequently.\nRodrigues is located 574 km east of Mauritius. It has an area of 108 km2, and reaches 393 meters elevation.\nSt. Brandon, also known as the Cargados Carajos shoals, is a coral atoll group consisting of a barrier reef, shoals, and low islets. It is the remnant of one -or more- large volcanic islands sitting on the Mauritia (microcontinent) which were submerged by rising tides. Today, the thirty or so islands that comprise St Brandon form part of the Republic of Mauritius. Around seventeen of the uninhabited islands are administered by the 'Outer Islands Development Corporation' of Mauritius (an entity run by the Prime Minister of Mauritius through the Prime Minister's Office) whilst the remaining Thirteen Islands of St. Brandon are managed by the Raphael Fishing Company from three permanently inhabited island bases of Ile Raphael, L'île du Sud (South Island, l'île Boisées) and L'Île Coco. The Raphael Fishing Company was granted these Thirteen Islands of St. Brandon under a 1901 Permanent Lease (999-year lease) which were adjudged as a Permanent Grant by determination of the Privy Council (United Kingdom) in 2008. These Thirteen islands of St. Brandon on Permanent Grant are L'île du Sud (South Island, l'île Boisée), Petit Fou, l'Avocaire, l'île aux Fous, L'île du Gouvernement, Petit Mapou, Grand Mapou, La Baleine, L'Île Coco, Île Raphael, Verronge, l'île aux Bois and Baleines Rocks.\nThere are several submerged banks or shoals:\n\nSaya de Malha Bank is a large, submerged bank. Prehistorically it was a group of volcanic islands and was enjoined to the Great Chagos Bank until continental drift pushed them apart.\nSoudan Banks are a group of low-lying banks on the Mascarene Plateau.\nNazareth Bank is located just north of Cargados Carajos, and prehistorically they were a single geological feature. Today it is a large, shallow fishing bank.\nHawkins Bank is located on the northernmost point of the Mascarene Plateau.\n\n\nGeology\n\nThe islands are volcanic in origin; Saya de Malha (35 mya) was the first of the Mascarene islands to rise out of the Indian Ocean due to the Réunion hotspot, followed by Nazareth Bank (approximately 2 mya later), Soudan Bank and Cargados Carajos. The youngest islands to form were Mauritius (7–10 mya), the oldest of the existing islands, created along with the undersea Rodrigues ridge. The islands of Rodrigues and Réunion were created in the last two million years. Réunion is the largest of the islands (2,500 km2), followed by Mauritius (1,900 km2) and Rodrigues (110 km2). Eventually, Saya de Malha, Nazareth and Soudan were completely submerged, Cargados Carajos remaining as a coral atoll. The Réunion hotspot was beginning to cool and Rodrigues came out as a small island.\nRéunion is home to the highest peaks in the Mascarenes, the shield volcanoes Piton des Neiges (3,069 m) and Piton de la Fournaise (2,525 m). Piton de la Fournaise, on the southeastern corner of Réunion, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting last in December 2021. Piton de la Petite Rivière Noire (828 m) is the highest peak on Mauritius, and the gentle hills of Rodrigues rise to only 390 m.\nThe Mascarene Plateau is an undersea plateau that extends approximately 2000 km, from the Seychelles to Réunion. The plateau covers an area of over 115,000 km2 of shallow water, with depths ranging from 8 to 150 meters, plunging to 4000 m to the abyssal plain at its edges. The southern part of the plateau, including the Saya de Malha Bank, Nazareth Bank, Soudan Banks and Cargados Carajos Shoals (Saint Brandon) (then one large island), was formed by the Réunion hotspot. These were once volcanic islands, much like Mauritius and Réunion, which have now sunk or eroded to below sea level or, in the case of the Cargados Carajos, to low coral islands. The Saya de Malha Bank formed 35 million years ago, and the Nazareth Bank and the Cargados Carajos shoals after that. Limestone banks found on the plateau are the remnants of coral reefs, indicating that the plateau was a succession of islands. Some of the banks may have been islands as recently as 18,000–6,000 years ago, when sea levels were as much as 130 meters lower during the most recent ice age.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe early colonial history of the islands, like that of the Caribbean, featured a succession of takeovers between rival powers: the Portuguese, Dutch, French and British all ruled some or all of the islands.\nAround 1507, the explorer Diogo Fernandes Pereira discovered the island group. The area remained under nominal Portuguese rule until Étienne de Flacourt arrived with a French naval squadron and took possession in 1649. From 4 June 1735 to 23 March 1746, a single French Mascarene Islands chartered colony under one gouverneur général (governor general) contained Isle de France (now Mauritius), Île Bourbon (Réunion) and Séchelles (Seychelles). On 14 July 1767 this became a French crown colony, still under one governor general. From 3 February 1803 until 2 September 1810 the French colony of Indes-Orientales, under a capitaine général (captain-general), included Réunion and (nominally) the Seychelles.\n\n\nMauritius\n\nIt is postulated from navigational charts, such as the Cantino planisphere of 1502, that Arab sailors first discovered Mauritius around 975, calling it Dina Arobi (abandoned island). The earliest confirmed discovery on record was in 1507 by Portuguese sailors. \nThe Dutch took physical possession in 1598, establishing a succession of short-lived settlements over a period of about 120 years, before abandoning their efforts in 1710.\nFrance took control in 1715, renaming it Isle de France. In 1810, the United Kingdom invaded the island to protect its East India ships coming around the Cape of Good Hope from French pirates. Four years later, at the Treaty of Paris, France ceded Mauritius and its dependencies to the United Kingdom. \nUnder British Mauritius (1810-1968), the island successfully developed as a sugar cane-based plantation economy and colony until independence in 1968.\n\n\nRodrigues\n\nRodrigues was first discovered by the Arabs but named after Portuguese navigator Diogo Rodrigues. It was under Dutch control in 1601 and settled by the French in 1691. Britain took possession of Rodrigues in 1809. When Mauritius gained independence in 1968, Rodrigues was forcefully joined to it. Rodrigues remains an autonomous region of Mauritius.\n\n\nRéunion\nRéunion was discovered first by the Arabs then by the Portuguese, who named it Santa Apolónia. It was then occupied by the French as part of Mauritius. It was first inhabited by French mutineers who arrived on the island between 1646 and 1669. It was given its current name in 1793. From 1810 to 1815 it was held by the British, before being returned to France. Réunion became an overseas department of France in 1946.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of the islands is tropical. At low elevations summer temperatures (December to April) average 30 °C. Winter temperatures (May to November) are generally cooler, around 25 °C. Temperatures are cooler in the mountains, averaging 18 °C. During the winter short-lived snow can fall on Réunion's high peaks.\nSoutheasterly trade winds blow throughout the year. Rainfall is generally higher on the windward sides of the islands. On Mauritius average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1905 mm on the windward southeast coast to 890 mm on the leeward side. Rainfall in the mountains is higher, varying from 2540 mm to 4445 mm annually. Tropical cyclones occur occasionally, bringing heavy rain and high winds, and causing erosion and landslides.\n\n\nFlora\n\nThe habitats of the Macarenes vary with the islands' size, topography, age, and proximity to Madagascar, the nearest major land mass. As is common among remote islands, the Mascarene fauna and flora display a high degree of endemism; they include over a thousand species of which several hundred are endemic. The Mascarene islands form a distinct ecoregion known as the Mascarene forests. Until Europeans first settled the islands in the sixteenth century the Mascarenes are not known to have harbored any human population, and the islands' wildlife was still flourishing during the early days of settlement. Today much of the natural vegetation is gone, and there are many introduced species on the islands.\nIn prehistoric times the islands were covered in a diverse range of tropical moist broadleaf forests. The plant communities are not homogeneous, and comprise at least five fairly distinct vegetation zones that reflect variations in altitude and in moisture regime. These include dry lowland forests, semi-dry sclerophyllous forests, lowland rainforests, montane cloud forests, and high-elevation heathlands on Réunion.\nCoastal habitats include beach vegetation, coastal wetlands, and swamp forests, grading into lowland rain forest on the windward sides of the islands and lowland dry forests to leeward.\nThe dry lowland forests are found on the leeward sides of the islands, from sea level to 200 metres in areas with less than 1000 mm of average annual rainfall. Palms are the dominant trees, including species of Latania and Dictyosperma album, along with the palm-like screw-pines (Pandanus spp.).\nSemi-dry sclerophyllous forests are found between the coast and 360 metres elevation on Mauritius and Rodrigues, and from 200 to 750 metres elevation on the western slopes of Réunion, where only small patches of such forest now remain. Average annual rainfall in the semi-dry forests ranges from 1000 to 1500 mm. Tree genera and families well-represented in the semi-dry forests include ebony species in the genus Diospyros (Ebenaceae), Pleurostylia (Celastraceae), Foetidia (Lecythidaceae), Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata (Oleaceae), Cossinia pinnata (Sapindaceae) Dombeya (Malvaceae), Terminalia bentzoe (Combretaceae), and Sideroxylon boutonianum, Sideroxylon borbonicum, and various species of Mimusops in family Sapotaceae. Shrubs in the semi-dry forests include several spectacular endemic species of Hibiscus (Malvaceae), Zanthoxylum (Rutaceae), Obetia ficifolia (Urticaceae), and Scolopia heterophylla (Flacourtiaceae).\nThe lowland rain forests are characterized by dense evergreen forests, composed of diverse species creating a canopy of 30 meters or more in height. They are found on the Mauritius' eastern lowlands from the coast to 800–900 metres elevation, and above 360 m on the western slopes. On Réunion lowland rain forests are found between 750 and 1100 m. They occur in areas with average annual rainfall of 1500 to 6000 mm. Characteristic trees include species of Mimusops and  Labourdonnaisia (Sapotaceae), Hernandia mascarenensis (Hernandiaceae), Calophyllum (Clusiaceae), and species of Syzygium, Eugenia, Sideroxylon, and Monimiastrum (Myrtaceae). Characteristic shrubs include species of Gaertnera, Chassalia, Bertiera, and Coffea in family Rubiaceae. Other plants include bamboos like Nastus borbonicus, numerous species of orchids (e.g., Angraecum, Bulbophyllum) and ferns e.g., Asplenium, Hymenophyllum, Trichomanes, Elaphoglossum, and Marattia fraxinea.\nThe cloud forests are evergreen rain forests found on mountain slopes with high rainfall. They occur on Réunion between 800 and 1900 metres elevation on eastern slopes with an average annual rainfall of 2000–10,000 mm, and between 1100 and 2000 metres on western slopes with an average annual rainfall of 2000–3000 mm. By 2005, relatively intact cloud forests still covered approximately 44,000 ha on Réunion. On Mauritius they are restricted to a small area of Montagne Cocotte in the island's southwest, above 750 metres elevation and with average annual rainfall of 4500–5500 mm. Trees form a dense canopy 6 to 10 metres high. Typical canopy trees include species of Dombeya on Réunion, and species of Monimia and Tambourissa (Monimiaceae) on both islands. There is an understory of  small trees and shrubs including species of Psiadia (Asteraceae) and Melicope (Rutaceae). The forests are rich in epiphytes (orchids, ferns, mosses, lichens), emergent tree ferns (Cyathea species), and, originally the palms Acanthophoenix rubra, but poaching has wiped out palms in many areas of Réunion. Three monodominant plant communities are also found in the cloud forests – forests of  Acacia heterophylla (Fabaceae) as the canopy tree, which are similar to the Acacia koa forests in Hawaii, thickets dominated by Erica reunionensis (Ericaceae), and hyperhumid forests of screw-pine (Pandanus montanus).\n\nSubalpine shrub occurs on the volcanoes on Réunion, above the treeline at 1800 to 2000 metres elevation. Average annual rainfall is from 2000 to 6000 mm, and frosts occur regularly in winter. Characteristic shrubs include Erica reunionensis and Erica galioides (Ericaceae), Stoebe passerinoides and species of Hubertia and Psiadia (Asteraceae), and Phylica nitida (Rhamnaceae). Herbaceous endemic species  include Heterochaenia rivalsii (Campanulaceae), Eriotrix commersonii (Asteraceae), and Cynoglossum borbonicum (Boraginaceae).\nRecent volcanic deposits on Réunion's volcanic summits are covered by sparse grasslands rich in endemic grasses, including Festuca borbonica, Agrostis salaziensis, and Cenchrus afer. along with orchids like Disa borbonica. Ericoid thickets and thickets of the small tree Sophora denudata  (Fabaceae) are found on weathered volcanic substrates.\nMost of the indigenous Mascarene flora and fauna are thought to have descended originally from Madagascan and African ancestors.\nThe four largest families present in the Mascarene Islands are Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae, Orchidaceae, and Euphorbiaceae, which comprise between 193 and 223 species each, for a total of 831 species, or 26.9% of the flowering plant flora. Another seven families contain 80 or more species each: Poaceae, Apocynaceae, Cyperaceae, Cunoniaceae, Rutaceae, Araliaceae, and Sapotaceae, representing an additional ca. 660 species in all, 21.3% of the angiosperm flora. Ferns are prominent components of the biotas of the islands, especially in the tropical forest. Most ferns disperse easily via ornithochory of their spores, allowing fairly frequent colonization from Madagascar and exchange among the Mascarene islands.\nThe Mascarenes are home to many endemic species of Dombeyoideae, the monotypic genus Psiloxylon (Psiloxylon mauritianum), and members of the family Monimiaceae (the genera Monimia and Trochetia, and species of Tambourissa) and Escalloniaceae. Indigenous trees include species of the genera Ocotea, Erythrina, Sideroxylon, and Foetidia. The palm genera Latania, Hyophorbe, Acanthophoenix, Dictyosperma, and Tectiphiala are all endemic to the Mascarene Islands. Other endemic genera include Berenice, Heterochaenia, Nesocodon, Ruizia, and Astiria.\nThere are 24 species of trees and shrubs in the Mascarenes from subfamily Dombeyoideae, 23 of which are endemic to the islands. The Macarenes' endemic species are polyphyletic and split into nine clades. Trochetia appears monophyletic and more closely related to Eriolaena and Helmiopsis than to Dombeya. All Dombeya taxa are included in a clade together with Ruizia and Astiria, this means that Dombeya is paraphyletic. In terms of breeding systems the Malagasy Dombeyoideae are hermaphroditic, whereas those of the Mascarenes are considered dioecious. The polyphyly of the Mascarene Dombeyoideae suggests that dioecy has been acquired several times. At least five colonization events from Madagascar to the Mascarene archipelago occurred. The evolutionary history of two lineages of Mascarene Domeyoideae seems to be related to adaption to xeric habitats.\nThe flora of the islands co-evolved with the island's unique fauna over millions of years. The human-caused extinction of several of the Mascarenes' land animals, and the introduction of exotic animals to the islands by humans, has disrupted the reproduction and thriving of various island plants. For example, the  Tambalacoque tree (Sideroxylon grandiflorum), often called the dodo tree, is not producing young trees and is threatened with extinction. The extinct dodo, Cylindraspis tortoises, and broad-billed parrots, along with fruit bats, played an important role in dispersing the seeds. Passing through the animals' digestive tract aided in the seeds' germination. However the trees' decline may be mostly due to introduced crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) destroying unripened seeds.\n\n\nFauna\n\nMuch of the Mascarenes' native fauna has become endangered or extinct since the human settlement of the islands in the 17th century. Settlers cleared most of the forests for agriculture and grazing, and introduced many exotic species, including pigs, rats, cats, monkeys, and mongooses.\n\n\nBirds\nMany of the Mascarene birds evolved into flightless forms, the most famous of which was the extinct flightless pigeon, the dodo of Mauritius. Thirteen additional species of birds became extinct, including the Réunion flightless ibis, broad-billed parrot, red rail, Rodrigues rail, and Rodrigues solitaire.\nContemporary sources state that the dodo used gizzard stones and could swallow Ocotea fruits. Seed distribution of at least some Ocotea species is performed by frugivorous birds and there exist a few reports of \"solitaires\" from the Mascarenes without mention of which island these came from, and the term was also used for other species with \"solitary\" habits, such as the Réunion blue swamphen and the Réunion sacred ibis. At one point it was even believed that Réunion was the home of not only a white dodo, but also a white solitaire. In 1786, sub-fossil bones were discovered in a cave which confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen living birds. The star constellation Turdus Solitarius was named after this bird.\nToday 17 endemic bird species survive on the islands. Two species – the Mascarene paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone bourbonnensis) and Mascarene swiftlet (Aerodramus francicus) – inhabit both Mauritius and Réunion. Eight species are endemic to Mauritius – the Mauritius grey white-eye, (Zosterops mauritianus), Mauritius cuckooshrike (Lalage typica), Mauritius kestrel (Falco punctatus), Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra), Mauritius bulbul (Hypsipetes olivaceus), Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula eques), Mauritius olive white-eye (Zosterops chloronothos), and pink pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri). The Réunion grey white-eye (Zosterops borbonicus), Réunion cuckooshrike (Lalage newtoni), Réunion stonechat (Saxicola tectes), Réunion olive white-eye (Zosterops olivaceus), and Réunion bulbul (Hypsipetes borbonicus) are endemic to Réunion. The Rodrigues warbler (Acrocephalus rodericanus) and Rodrigues fody (Foudia flavicans) are found only on Rodrigues.\n\n\nReptiles\nMauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were also once each home to one or more species of giant tortoises, now extinct, which comprised the genus Cylindraspis. There are 13 living endemic reptile species, including a number of species of day geckoes (genus Phelsuma).\n\n\nMammals\nThe islands' only native mammals are bats, including the Mauritian flying fox (Pteropus niger), which is endemic to Mauritius and Réunion, and the Rodrigues flying fox (Pteropus rodricensis) found only on Rodrigues. The lesser Mascarene flying fox (Pteropus subniger) is extinct.\n\n\nFreshwater\nThe three largest islands have many freshwater streams which descend from the mountains to the sea. The upper reaches, particularly on Réunion, are fast-flowing and steep with numerous waterfalls. Tamarin Falls or Sept Cascades (293 m) on Mauritius is the highest waterfall on Mauritius, while Cascade Trou de Fer (725 m, ranks 23rd worldwide) on Réunion is the highest of the Mascarenes.\nThe Grand River South East (34 km) is the longest river on Mauritius, followed by Rivière du Poste (23 km), Grand River North West (22 km), Rivière La Chaux (22 km), and Rivière des Créoles (20 km). Mauritius has two natural crater lakes, Grand Bassin and Bassin Blanc.\nThere are about twenty species of fish which spend at least part of their lives in freshwater. The islands have five endemic freshwater fish species, all gobies (Gobiiformes) – Hypseleotris cyprinoides, Cotylopus acutipinnis, Glossogobius kokius, Gobius commersonii, and Oxyurichthys guibei. Cotylopus acutipinnis, which is endemic to Réunion, hatches in the sea before migrating to the rainforest streams where it lives its adult life.\n\n\nMarine\nThe Mascarene Islands are surrounded by approximately 750 square km of coral reef. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon, 7 to 20 km wide, with deep channels. Mauritius is also surrounded by a fringing reef. In contrast, Réunion has very short stretches of narrow fringing reef along the western and southwestern coasts only. The islets of the Cargados Carajos Shoals, which have a very depauperate terrestrial biota owing to being so low-lying and swamped during cyclones, are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef, which accounts for ~30% of the reefs of the Mascarene Islands. Lagoon reefs and reef flats are dominated by scleractinian corals such as branching and tabular Acropora, Porites massives, foliaceous Montipora and Pavona, and sand consolidated with beds of seagrass such Halophila (Hydrocharitaceae).\nAmong coral reef fishes, wrasses (Labridae), damselfish (Pomacentridae), carnivorous groupers (Serranidae), and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) have many species.\n\n\nWildlife, threats, and preservation\n\nMauritius has one of the highest population densities in the world. All of the islands have experienced significant losses of habitats. Many of the surviving endemic species are still threatened with extinction and have little protection. Less than 40 percent of Réunion is covered with natural vegetation, only about 5 percent of Mauritius, and almost none of Rodrigues. On Réunion, forest has been cleared for agriculture and then overtaken by introduced plants. Mauritius was largely converted to sugar cane, tea, and conifer plantations. On Rodrigues, shifting cultivation has caused the damage.\n\n\nLaunch of Saint Brandon Conservation Trust\nOn 8 May 2024, Saint Brandon Conservation Trust, an independent Mauritian NGO, was internationally launched at the Corporate Council on Africa in Dallas, Texas, to protect St. Brandon from pollution and to protect surviving flora and fauna in the Cargados Carajos.\n\n\nProtected areas\nProtected areas constitute 40.6% of the Mascarene Islands' land area. Terrestrial protected areas on Mauritius include Black River Gorges National Park, Bras d'Eau National Park, Perrier Nature Reserve, Corps de Garde Nature Reserve, Le Pouce Nature Reserve, Cabinet Nature Reserve, Gouly Pere Nature Reserve, and Bois Sec Nature Reserve. There are 32 designated protected areas on Réunion, including Réunion National Park (1055.15 km2), which cover 63.13% of the island.\n\n\nSee also\nSt. Brandon\nÎle Raphael\nL'île du Sud\nAvocaré Island\nFrance Staub\nL'île du Gouvernement\nÎle Verronge\nConstitution of Mauritius\nMauritian Wildlife Foundation\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nQuammen, David, (1996) The Song of the Dodo.

They cover the lower Atlantic coastal plain and are bordered on the west by the Southeastern mixed forests.\nThe habitats of the ecoregion are constantly modified by natural processes. The bottomlands, coastal plains, and maritime areas are vulnerable to tropical cyclones and floods. The drier areas with porous sandy soils are susceptible to fires and drought. Fire return intervals of 1 to 3 years favor herbaceous plants; longer intervals favor dense shrubs, to broadleaved evergreen trees.\n\n\nClimate\nThis ecoregion has a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters, and with the heaviest precipitation concentrated in the warmest months.\n\n\nFlora\nTwo basic types of forests are found in this region; 1) Southern mixed hickory-pine-oak forests that see frequent fire with sandy soils, and 2) isolated patches of evergreen broadleaved forests and \"hammocks\" close to the Atlantic coastline in the southernmost areas in coastal South Carolina and coastal Georgia.\nThe mixed pine-oak forests occur on dry or sandy soils or in areas exposed to occasional fires. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), superbly adapted to fire-prone environments, was the principal tree in many of these forests; however, extensive logging and human development have reduced this trees occurrence to less than 5% of its former range. Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) grow in sandy soils and are still dominant in this ecosystem. Loblolly is widely planted on millions of acres of plantation forest's across the southeastern US. On moist soils or where fires are infrequent, hardwoods overtake the pines. These hardwoods include turkey oak (Quercus laevis), post oak (Quercus stellata), myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia), Spanish oak (Quercus falcata), and southern catalpa (Catalpa bignonioides). \nEvergreen broadleaved forests occur close to the coast in localized areas as either evergreen Maritime oak forests or as more localized evergreen hammocks (geographically induced forest islands) (Box 1985). These forests consist of evergreen broadleaved and needled canopy trees, such as Magnolia grandiflora, Magnolia virginiana, Tamala borbonia, Gordonia lasianthus, Sabal, Juniperus virginiana, Pinus taeda, and several evergreen oaks such as Quercus myrtifolia and the iconic Quercus virginiana or southern live oak often covered with Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides). The understory is also often evergreen in these forests, with Myrica cerifera and Osmanthus americanus very common, while several evergreen species of Ericaceae, Ilex, and scrub palms (Sabal minor and Serenoa) are common on more moist sites. In the open areas near sandy beaches and coastal areas, large endemic populations of Yucca and cactus (Opuntia) thrive in the hot sun and sandy soils.\nThe Middle Atlantic coastal forests contain the most diverse assemblage of freshwater wetland communities in North America. These include freshwater marshes, shrub bogs, white cedar swamps, bayheads, and wet hammocks.\nThe bottomland hardwood forests for which the ecoregion is famous are dominated by bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora).\nBald cypress swamps are often dominated by their namesake tree, and are too wet for foot travel. Many uncommon orchids grow among the baldcypress branches.\nSwamp tupelo, along with water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), dominate mixed-hardwood swamp forests. These grow aside water-adapted oaks that include water oak (Quercus nigra), swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii), cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda), willow oak (Quercus phellos), and overcup oak (Quercus lyrata). Swamp hickory (Carya glabra) and water hickory (Carya aquatica) are also found here. Pawpaw (Asimina triloba) grows in the understory.\nAtlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps occur along blackwater rivers.\nThe American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) is found throughout the ecoregion.  \nPocosins are flat and damp, sandy, or peaty areas far from streams. They have scattered pond pine (Pinus serotina) and a dense growth of mostly evergreen shrubs including gallberry (Ilex glabra).\nBarrier islands along the coast protect extensive estuaries, lagoons, and sounds.\nCarolina bays are a unique habitat of the ecoregion.\n\n\nFauna\nThe nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) is a distinctive animal that lives in this ecoregion. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is abundant.\nIn the mixed pine-oak forests, the brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) feeds on pine seeds. The yellow-throated warbler (Dendroica dominica) is widely distributed. The northern parula (Parula americana) and the eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) are also found here. The Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) and red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), both uncommon, also live in this ecoregion.\nThe bottomland forests support abundant arthropods, produce mast that sustains migratory birds during the winter, and produce boles, branch cavities, and rotting logs that support various detritivores and hole-nesting species. In the extreme southeast regions (coastal southeast North Carolina south to Georgia) the large American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) can be found along tidal inlets and marsh areas.\n\n\nContemporary land use\nThe main causes of habitat conversion are agriculture, fire suppression, urbanization, coastal development, ditching and draining of wetlands, and damming of rivers.\nThe western part of the ecoregion has been most altered. There, the upland vegetation has been nearly completely converted.\nLong-leaf pine savannas have nearly disappeared.\nThe least altered habitats in the ecoregion are the coastal marshes and deep peatlands.\n\n\nRemaining intact habitat\nFrancis Marion National Forest (SC)\nPine Barrens (NJ)\nHolly Shelter Gamelands (NC)\nCroatan National Forest (NC)\nCongaree National Park (SC)\nOuter Banks (NC)\nPamlimarle Peninsula (NC)\nPrime Hook National Wildlife Refuge (DE)\nRoanoke River (VA)\nSandhills Gameland (NC)\nSandhill National Wildlife Refuge (SC)\nGreat Dismal Swamp (VA and NC)\nGreat Cypress Swamp (DE and MD)\nAssateague Island (MD and VA)\nVirginia Coast Reserve (VA)\nCape Romain (SC)\nFort Bragg (NC)\nFort Jackson (SC)\nFort Stewart (GA)\nCape May National Wildlife Refuge (NJ)\n\n\nSee also\nList of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Mid-Atlantic United States Coastal Savannas Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1326434031, "rev_timestamp": "2025-12-08T23:43:29Z", "source": "enwiki"}

The Shire Highlands includes the Zomba Plateau (2,087 m) in the north and the Thyolo Mountains (1,462 m) to the south.\nThe low valley of the Shire River, part of the African Rift Valley system, bounds the Shire Highlands to the northwest, west, and southwest. The valley of the Ruo River, a tributary of the Shire, bounds the ecoregion on the south and southeast. The Phalombe Plain and the valley of Lake Chilwa lie to the northeast.\nThe ecoregion enjoyed lush forests, fertile soils, ample water, and mild climate, and is one of the most densely populated regions of Malawi. Blantyre, Malawi's second-largest city, is in the Shire Highlands. Tea is grown commercially in the highlands, especially around Thyolo and Mulanje, and is one of Malawi's chief exports.\nThe highlands' climate and geology are home to communities of plants and animals distinct from the woodland and savanna ecoregions of the surrounding lowlands. The ecoregion is bounded to the southeast by the Eastern miombo woodlands, and to the northwest by the Southern miombo woodlands. The generally drier Zambezian and mopane woodlands lie to the southwest in the Zambezi lowlands, and to the east in the basin of Lake Chilwa.\n\n\nClimate\nThe ecoregion has a tropical highlands climate, generally cooler and more humid than the surrounding lowlands. There is a single summer rainy season between November and April. Moisture-bearing winds from the southeast, known as Chiperone weather, provide occasional moisture during the dry season, producing mist and rain as they encounter the mountain slopes. Northern and western slopes are generally drier than the south and east-facing slopes.\nFrosts occur at the highest elevations in the Mulanje Massif.\n\n\nFlora\nThe ecoregion has several distinct plant communities, which vary with elevation and exposure.\nUntil recently, rainforests were predominant on the southern and southeastern slopes of Mt. Mulanje, with the trees Newtonia buchananii and Khaya anthotheca predominant. Most have been cleared, but remnants exist in stream valleys.\nMid-elevation forests are found between 900 and 1,350 meters elevation. Newtonia buchananii, Albizia adianthifolia, Funtumia africana, and Gambeya gorungosana are the dominant trees in the low-canopy forest, and host many lichens, mosses and epiphytes.\nAfromontane forests occur in fragmented patches above 1600 meters elevation, with Mulanje cedar (Widdringtonia whytei), Olea capensis, Podocarpus milanjianus, Ekebergia capensis, Cassipourea malosana, and Myrsine melanophloeos as the dominant trees. Mulanje cedar is endemic to the ecoregion, found only on Mulanje in valley forests protected from fire.\nOther plant communities include tussock grasslands, and Afromontane heathlands on the highest elevations of Mulanje.\n\n\nFauna\nThe region hosts a large variety of wildlife many of which cannot be found elsewhere. Birds like the Yellow-throated apalis and the Thyolo alethe (Chamaetylas choloensis) are either fully or partially endemic to the region.\n\n\nProtected areas\nProtected areas in the ecoregion include:\n\nLengwe National Park\nMajete Wildlife Reserve\nChiradzulu Forest Reserve\nMalosa Forest Reserve\nMichiru Mountain Conservation Area\nMulanje Mountain Forest Reserve\nThyolo Forest Reserve\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Mulanje Montane Forest-Grassland Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1316737612, "rev_timestamp": "2025-10-14T05:59:51Z", "source": "enwiki"}

There are several modern human settlements in the bioregion including Ivanhoe and Manilla, and it also contains some of the oldest known human occupation sites in Australia.\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe plains have a dry Mediterranean climate with more rainfall (400mm per year) in the south than in the drier north (250mm). Fires are common in the hot dry summers.\n\n\nWetlands\nThe depression is home to numerous wetlands which are in turn home to many rare and endangered animal and plant species. Major wetlands within the bioregion include the Darling Anabranch Lakes, Conoble Lake, Lake Victoria, Willandra lakes, and Gunnaramby Swamp.\n\n\nFlora\nThe original vegetation of the basin was mallee eucalyptus woodlands with thicker black box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) and river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodland on riverbanks but most has been cleared for wheat farming and pasture. The flora of the plain need to be adapted to renew itself after the summer droughts and accompanying fires.\nAustrostipa nullanulla, an endangered type of spear grass, has been identified as regionally endemic to the nearby areas. Several other rare plant species such as the Eriocaulon australasicum, and the Codonocarpus pyramidali are found here and considered to be relict populations.\n\n\nFauna\nWildlife of the area includes large numbers of lizards, ants, and honeyeater birds (especially of the Lichenostomus and Meliphaga genera). Lizards include species of skink (especially of Ctenotus, Egernia, and Lerista genera). Ants include species of Iridomyrmex, carpenter ants, and Melophorus. Endangered species include the black-eared miner bird (Manorina melanotis) and the malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).\n\n\nGeology\nShallow seas moving across the plains several times over the last 50-60 million years have left a unique geological footprint in the area and geological records have indicated that at one point the seas coast stretched as far inland as modern day Balranald. In areas where the surface geology interact with the saline water table unique salt basins have formed. Lunettes can be observed along the edges of various lakes and swamps throughout the bioregion, these lunettes have kept record of the surrounding environment and have been used as evidence to demonstrate climate change in the area.\n\n\nAboriginal history\nEvidence of early human habitation dating back to at least 50,000 years can be found in the Willandra lakes region and concealed within the sand dunes surrounding Lake Mungo.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nAlthough much of the plain was cleared in the past (missing reference), this is now carefully controlled (missing reference) and areas of protected natural vegetation remain, especially in the large Ngarkat Conservation Park - Big Desert Wilderness Park on the South Australia-Victoria border. Threats to habitats today come from introduced weeds, over-salination of rivers as water is drawn off for irrigation, over-use of fire to remove dry shrubs and prevent forest fires and overgrazing by introduced goats and rabbits.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Murray-Darling Woodlands and Mallee Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1329029169, "rev_timestamp": "2025-12-23T05:57:09Z", "source": "enwiki"}
{"eco_id": 395, "eco_name": "Nebraska Sand Hills mixed grasslands", "wiki_title": "Sandhills (Nebraska)", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhills_(Nebraska)", "extract_text": "The Sandhills, often written Sand Hills, is a region of mixed-grass prairie on grass-stabilized sand dunes in north-central Nebraska, covering just over one quarter of the state. The dunes were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1984.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe boundaries of the Sandhills are variously defined by different organizations. Depending on the definition, the region's area can be as small as 19,600 mi2 (50,760 km2) or as large as 23,600 mi2 (61,100 km2).\nDunes in the Sandhills may exceed 330 ft (100 m) in height. The average elevation of the region gradually increases from about 1,800 ft (550 m) in the east to about 3,600 ft (1,100 m) in the west.\nThe Sandhills sit atop the massive Ogallala Aquifer; thus both temporary and permanent shallow lakes are common in low-lying valleys between the grass-stabilized dunes prevalent in the Sandhills. The eastern and central sections of the region are drained by tributaries of the Loup River and the Niobrara River, while the western section is largely composed of small interior drainage basins.\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) designated the Sandhills as an ecoregion, distinct from other grasslands of the Great Plains. According to their assessment, as much as 85% of the ecoregion is intact natural habitat, the highest level in the Great Plains. This is chiefly due to the lack of crop production; most of the Sandhills land has never been plowed.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Sandhills is classified as a semi-arid region, with average annual rainfall varying from 23 inches (580 mm) in the east to less than 17 inches (430 mm) of rain in the west.  Temperatures range from lows of −30 °F (−34 °C) to highs of 105 °F (41 °C).\n\n\nPaleoclimate and future\nPaleoclimate proxy data and computer simulations reveal that the Nebraska Sandhills likely had active sand dunes as recently as the Medieval Warm Period, when temperatures in the North Atlantic region were about 1 °C (1.8 °F) warmer than the current climate. Much of the area was a scrub desert, with desert-like conditions extending to several other states. Current global warming may make the grassland climate more unstable, giving way to desert given more fires, mild drought and erosion; UCAR simulations based on evapotranspiration support a Palmer Drought Index lower than -15, many times more severe than Texas during the Dust Bowl.\n\n\nHistory\nThe plant-anchored dunes of the Sandhills were long considered an irreclaimable desert. In the 1870s, cattlemen began to discover their potential as rangeland for Longhorn cattle.\nThe fragility of the sandy soil makes the area unsuitable for cultivation of crops. Attempts at farming were made in the region in the late 1870s and again around 1890.\nThe 1904 Kinkaid Act allowed homesteaders to claim 640 acres (260 ha; 2.6 km2) of land, rather than the 160 acres (65 ha; 0.65 km2) allowed by the 1862 Homestead Act.  Nearly nine million acres (36,000 km2) were claimed by \"Kinkaiders\" between 1910 and 1917. Some of the Kinkaiders farmed the land, but these attempts generally failed. This included Nebraska's largest black settlement, DeWitty, which was located in southeast Cherry County until the 1930s. Many of the largest ranches broke up about the same time due to regulations against fencing federal range lands.\nSome development of cropland agriculture in the modern era has occurred through the use of center-pivot irrigation systems.\nIn the 21st century, the Sandhills are a productive cattle ranching area, supporting over 530,000 beef cattle. The human population of the region continues to decline as older generations die out, younger generations move to the cities, and ranches are consolidated. A number of small towns remain in the region.\n\n\nEcology\nThe Sandhills contain a large array of plant and animal life. Minimal crop production has led to limited land fragmentation; the resulting extensive and continuous habitat for plant and animal species has largely preserved the biodiversity of the area.\nThe Sandhills are home to 314 vertebrate species including mule deer, whitetail deer, jackrabbits, pronghorn antelope, elk, coyotes, red fox, Western meadowlarks (the Nebraska state bird), prairie dogs, bull snakes, prairie rattlesnakes, ringnecked pheasant, sharp-tailed grouse, badgers, ground squirrels, skunks, native bat species and many fish species.\nThe Sandhills' thousands of ponds and lakes are spring-fed surface water areas of the Ogallala Aquifer. Precipitation is insufficient to keep ponds and lakes permanent with the low humidity and high evaporation rates. The natural reservoirs are also primarily confined to a few regions of the Sandhills with the vast majority located in northern Garden County.  The lakes and ponds are mainly sandy-bottomed, and some contain many species of fish. Very few are used to water cattle, as the water is usually shallow, warm, brackish, turbid (cloudy), saline, or alkaline; ponds may also conceal \"quicksand\" that could trap cattle. Easily accessible aquifer water (groundwater) is commonly pumped by windmills and solar-powered submersible electric pumps to fill cement-bottom steel stock tanks up to 30 feet (9.1 metres) in diameter, to supply livestock with cool, fresh water. Some alkaline lakes in the area support several species of phyllopod shrimp.\n\n\nPlants\n720 different species of plants are found in the Sandhills. Most are native, with only 7% exotics — half the percentage of most other prairie systems. Most of the \"exotics\" are invasive species and considered noxious weeds and must be destroyed by landowners. One species threatening the ecosystem is the eastern redcedar. Native to the region but controlled by wildfires prior to European settlement, the trees were planted in great numbers as a windbreak around homesteads and during early Arbor Day events during early settlement. Over time, the trees spread to replace large areas of grassland, leading to ecosystem collapse on ranchlands.\nThe blowout penstemon (Penstemon haydenii) is an endangered species, found only in the Sandhills and in similar environments in central Wyoming. The blowout penstemon stabilizes the soil where wind erosion exposes the bare sand and creates a blowout, but is choked out when other species begin to recolonize. Grazing and land management practices used by Sandhills ranchers have reduced natural erosion, thus destroying some of the plant's habitat.\nMany of the plants of the Sandhills are sand-tolerant species from short-grass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairies; plants from all three of these can be found within the ecosystem. These plants have helped to stabilize the sand dunes, creating an ecosystem beneficial for other plants and animals. Better land management and grazing practices by the ranchers of the region have led to less erosion over time, which has kept the natural landscape of the area mostly intact.\n\n\nInsects\nMany species of insect are found in the Sandhills, including dragonflies, grasshoppers and mosquitos.  There are also many types of spiders. Due to the warm stagnant nature of both alkaline and freshwater lakes throughout the region, coupled with the wetland marsh areas, mosquito populations increase during the summer months.\n\n\nBirds\nThe Sandhills are part of the Central Flyway for many species of migratory birds, and the region's many bodies of water give them places to rest.  The ponds and lakes of the region are lay-over points for migratory cranes (particularly Sandhill cranes), geese, and many species of ducks. Species found year-round include the western meadowlark, the state bird of Nebraska.\n\n\nConservation efforts and protection\nValentine National Wildlife Refuge, located about 20 miles (32 km) south of Valentine, encompasses 71,516 acres (28,941 ha). Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge in the central Panhandle covers 45,849 acres (18,554 ha). The Nature conservancy's Niobrara Valley Preserve in Cherry, Brown, and Keya Paha counties covers 60,000 acres (240 km2) and includes a 25-mile (40 km) stretch of the river. Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge near Valentine covers 19,000 acres (77 km2). Partnering in the effort to conserve the Sandhills are the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, West Central Research and Extension Station, the Nature Conservancy of Nebraska, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Nebraska Natural Heritage Program, the University of Nebraska, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\nTurner Enterprises has acquired 445,000 acres (180,000 ha) of land in Nebraska. His extensive ranches for grazing cattle are known for their bison while focusing on sustainable practices such as rotational grazing of the grasslands. In 2021, Ted Turner announced that an 80,000-acre (32,000 ha) ranch he owns in western Nebraska would be turned over to the newly created Turner Institute of Ecoagriculture. Turner and the institute publicly announced that the nonprofit would continue to pay property taxes on the land.\n\n\nTransCanada Keystone XL Project\nA November 10, 2011 press release on the Keystone Pipeline Project Presidential Permit Review Process, announced that the U. S. State Department would assess TransCanada Keystone XL Project (Hardisty-Baker-Steele City) proposal. \"[G]iven the concentration of concerns regarding the environmental sensitivities of the current proposed route through the Sand Hills area of Nebraska, the Department has determined it needs to undertake an in-depth assessment of potential alternative routes in Nebraska [...] The comments were consistent with the information in the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) about the unique combination of characteristics in the Sand Hills (which includes a high concentration of wetlands of special concern, a sensitive ecosystem, and extensive areas of very shallow groundwater) and provided additional context and information about those characteristics. The concern about the proposed route's impact on the Sand Hills of Nebraska has increased significantly over time, and has resulted in the Nebraska legislature convening a special session to consider the issue.\"\nOn November 3, 2015, the request for a Presidential Permit was denied.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBleed, Ann (1990).

It stretches from Yemen to the Persian Gulf and Oman to Jordan and Iraq. It is the fourth largest desert in the world and the largest in Asia. At its center is Ar-Rub' al-Khali (The Empty Quarter), one of the largest continuous bodies of sand in the world. It is an extension of the Sahara Desert.\nGazelles, oryx, sand cats, and spiny-tailed lizards are just some of the desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment, which features everything from red dunes to deadly quicksand. The climate is mostly dry (the major part receives around 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain per year, but some very rare places receive as little as 50 mm), and temperatures oscillate between very high heat and seasonal night time freezes. It is part of the deserts and xeric shrublands biome and lie in biogeographical realms of the Palearctic (northern part) and Afrotropical (southern part).\nThe Arabian Desert ecoregion has little biodiversity, although a few endemic plants grow here. Many species, such as the striped hyena, jackal and honey badger, have died out as a result of hunting, habitat destruction, overgrazing by livestock, off-road driving, and human encroachment on their habitat. Other species, such as the Arabian sand gazelle, have been successfully re-introduced and are protected at reserves.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe desert lies mostly in Saudi Arabia and covers most of the country. It extends into neighboring southern Iraq, southern Jordan, central Qatar, most of the Abu Dhabi emirate in the United Arab Emirates, western Oman, and northeastern Yemen. The ecoregion also includes most of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and the adjacent Negev desert in southern Israel.\nThe Rub' al-Khali desert is a sedimentary basin stretching along a south-west to north-east axis across the Arabian Shelf. At an altitude of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), rock landscapes yield to the Rub' al-Khali, a vast stretch of sand whose extreme southern point crosses the center of Yemen. The sand overlies gravel or gypsum plains and the dunes reach maximum heights of up to 250 m (820 ft). The sands are predominantly silicates, composed of 80 to 90% quartz and the remainder feldspar, whose iron oxide-coated grains color the sands orange, purple, and red.\nA corridor of sandy terrain known as the Ad-Dahna desert connects the An-Nafud desert (65,000 km2 or 40,389 square miles) in the north of Saudi Arabia to the Rub' al-Khali in the south-east. The Tuwaiq escarpment is an 800 km (500 mi) arc that includes limestone cliffs, plateaus, and canyons. There are brackish salt flats, including the quicksands of Umm al Samim. The Sharqiya Sands, formerly known as Wahiba Sands of Oman are an isolated sand sea bordering the east coast.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Arabian Desert has a subtropical, hot desert climate, similar to the climate of the Sahara Desert (the world's largest hot desert). The Arabian Desert is actually an extension of the Sahara Desert over the Arabian peninsula. \nThe climate is mainly dry. Most areas get around 100 mm (3.9 in) of rain per year. Unlike the Sahara Desert—more than half of which is hyperarid (having rainfall of less than 50 mm (2.0 in) per year)—the Arabian Desert has only a few hyperarid areas. These rare driest areas may get only 30 to 40 mm (1.6 in) of rain per year. \nThe Arabian Desert’s sunshine duration index is very high by global standards: between 2,900 hours (66.2% of daylight hours) and 3,600 hours (82.1% of daylight hours), but typically around 3,400 hours (77.6% of daylight hours).  Thus clear-sky conditions with plenty of sunshine prevail over the region throughout the year, and cloudy periods are infrequent. Visibility at ground level is relatively low, despite the brightness of the sun and moon, because of dust and humidity. \nTemperatures remain high year round. In the summer, in low-lying areas, average high temperatures are generally over 40 °C (104 °F). In extremely low-lying areas, especially along the Persian Gulf (near sea level), summer temperatures can reach 48 °C (118 °F). Average low temperatures in summer are typically over 20 °C (68 °F) and in the south can sometimes exceed 30 °C (86 °F). Record high temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F) have been reached in many areas of the desert, partly because its overall elevation is relatively low. \n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe Arabian Desert ecoregion has about 900 species of plants. The Rub'al-Khali has very limited floristic diversity. There are only 37 plant species, 20 recorded in the main body of the sands and 17 around the outer margins. Of these 37 species, one or two are endemic. Vegetation is very diffuse but fairly evenly distributed, with some interruptions of near sterile dunes. Some typical plants are Calligonum crinitum on dune slopes, Cornulaca arabica (saltbush), Salsola stocksii (saltbush), and Cyperus conglomeratus. Other widespread species are Dipterygium glaucum, Limeum arabicum, and Zygophyllum mandavillei.\nVery few trees are found except at the outer margin (typically Acacia ehrenbergiana and Prosopis cineraria). Other species are a woody perennial Calligonum comosum, and annual herbs such as Danthonia forskallii.\nThere are 102 native species of mammals. Native mammals include the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), sand gazelle (Gazella marica), mountain gazelle (G. gazella), Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana), Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs), striped hyaena (Hyaena hyaena), caracal (Caracal caracal), sand cat (Felis margarita), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and Cape hare (Lepus capensis). The Asiatic cheetah and Asiatic lion used to live in the Arabian Desert. The ecoregion is home to 310 bird species.\n\n\nPeople\nThe area is home to several different cultures, languages, and peoples, with Islam as the predominant faith. The major ethnic group in the region is the Arabs, whose primary language is Arabic.\nIn the center of the desert lies Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with more than 7 million inhabitants. Other large cities, such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, or Kuwait City, lie on the coast of the Persian Gulf.\n\n\nNatural resources\nNatural resources available in the Arabian Desert include oil, natural gas, phosphates, and sulfur.\n\n\nConservation and threats\nThreats to the ecoregion include overgrazing by livestock and feral camels and goats, wildlife poaching, and damage to vegetation by off-road driving.\nThe conservation status of the desert is critical/endangered. In the UAE, the sand gazelle and Arabian oryx are threatened, and honey badgers, jackals, and striped hyaenas already extirpated.\n\n\nProtected areas\n4.37% of the ecoregion is in protected areas.\nSaudi Arabia has established a system of reserves overseen by the National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development (NCWCD).\n\nHarrat al-Harrah Reserve (12,150 km2), established in 1987, is on the border with Jordan and Iraq, and protects a portion of the stony basaltic Harrat al-Sham desert. The reserve includes rough terrain of black basaltic boulders and extinct volcanic cones from the middle Miocene. It provides habitat to over 250 species of plants, 50 species of birds, and 22 mammal species.\n'Uruq Bani Ma'arid Reserve (12,000 km2) is on the western edge of the Rub’ al-Khali. Arabian oryx and sand gazelle were reintroduced to the reserve in 1995.\nIbex Reserve (200 km2) is south of Riyadh. It protects Nubian ibex and a reintroduced  population of mountain gazelle.\nAl-Tabayq Special Nature Reserve is in northern Saudi Arabia, and protects a population of Nubian ibex.\nProtected areas in the United Arab Emirates include Al Houbara Protected Area (2492.0 km2), Al Ghadha Protected Area (1087.51 km2), Arabian Oryx Protected Area (5974.47 km2), Ramlah Protected Area (544.44 km2), and Al Beda'a Protected Area (417.0 km2).\n\n\nSee also\n\nʿĀd\nIram of the Pillars\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Arabian Desert\".

{"eco_id": 358, "eco_name": "North Cascades conifer forests", "wiki_title": "Cascades (ecoregion)", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascades_(ecoregion)", "extract_text": "The Cascades ecoregion is a Level III ecoregion designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, and California. Somewhat smaller than the Cascade mountain range for which it is named, the ecoregion extends north to Snoqualmie Pass, near Seattle, and south to Hayden Pass, near the Oregon-California border, including the peaks and western slopes of most of the High Cascades. A discontiguous section is located on Mount Shasta in California.\nThe mountainous region is underlain by Cenozoic volcanic rock that has been affected by alpine glaciations. The eastern part of the region contains active and dormant volcanoes in the Cascades Volcanic Arc, with elevations of up to 14,411 feet (4,392 m). The western Cascades are older, lower, and dissected by numerous, steep-sided stream valleys. The region has a moist, temperate climate, which supports an extensive and highly productive coniferous forest that is intensively managed for logging, as well as recreational use. Subalpine meadows occur at higher elevations.\nMuch of the region consists of public lands managed by the federal government, including the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie, Wenatchee, Gifford Pinchot, Mount Hood, Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue River National Forests; the Clearwater, Norse Peak, Tatoosh, William O. Douglas, Goat Rocks, Mount Adams, Indian Heaven, Trapper Creek, Salmon–Huckleberry, Mount Hood, Table Rock, Bull of the Woods, Opal Creek, Middle Santiam, Menagerie, Mount Jefferson, Mount Washington, Three Sisters, Diamond Peak, Boulder Creek, Mount Thielsen, Rogue–Umpqua Divide, Sky Lakes, and Mountain Lakes Wilderness Areas; Mount Rainier and Crater Lake National Parks; and the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.\nThe Cascades is bordered on the north by the North Cascades ecoregion, on the south by the Klamath Mountains ecoregion, on the east by the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills, and on the west by the Willamette Valley and Puget Lowland ecoregions. It been subdivided into six Level IV ecoregions in Washington and Oregon, as described below. Level IV mapping is not yet complete in California.\nAnimals include black bears, deer, elk, bobcats, cougars, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, and chipmunks. Wolves were extirpated in the early 20th century but a few packs have recolonized the ecoregion. In April 2024, the NPS and USFWS announced a decision to reintroduce grizzly bears to the North Cascades in Washington.\n\n\nLevel IV ecoregions\n\n\nWestern Cascades Lowlands and Valleys (4a)\nThe Western Cascades Lowlands and Valleys ecoregion comprises a network of steep ridges and narrow valleys on the lower slopes of the Cascade Mountains. Elevation varies from 600 to 4,000 feet (180 to 1,220 m). Its mild, wet climate promotes lush forests dominated by western hemlock and Coast douglas-fir, with western redcedar, bigleaf maple, red alder, vine maple, salal, rhododendron, Oregon grape, huckleberry, thimbleberry, swordfern, oxalis, hazel, and blackberry. Soils are warmer here than in higher elevation ecoregions, and it is one of the most important timber producing areas in the Pacific Northwest. The steep valleys trending to the west contain high and medium gradient rivers and streams that support cold water salmonids, including the threatened Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Notable river drainages in Oregon include the North Umpqua, North and Middle Forks of the Willamette, McKenzie, North Santiam, South Santiam, Clackamas, Salmon and Bull Run River watersheds; and in Washington, the Lewis, Cowlitz, Nisqually, Puyallup, White, and Green River watersheds. Reservoirs store winter snowmelt for irrigation and municipal water supply in the Willamette Valley. The Westerns Cascades Lowlands and Valleys is the largest of the Cascades subregions, covering 3,905 square miles (10,110 km2) in Oregon and 2,397 square miles (6,208 km2) in Washington.\n\n\nWestern Cascades Montane Highlands (4b)\nThe Western Cascades Montane Highlands ecoregion is characterized by steeply sloping, dissected mountains with high to medium gradient streams and glacial rock-basin lakes. Elevation varies from 3,000 and 6,500 feet (910 and 2,000 m). The western Cascades are older and more eroded than the lava plateau and prominent snow-covered cones of the High Cascades to the east. They are underlain by dark basalt in contrast to the gray andesite of the High Cascades. The region has lower temperatures and receives more winter snow than the lowlands and valleys to the west. Soils have a frigid or cryic temperature regimes. Abundant precipitation supports forests dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock, with mountain hemlock, noble fir, subalpine fir, grand fir, Pacific silver fir, red alder, and Pacific yew, and an understory of vine maple, rhododendron, Oregon grape, huckleberry, and thimbleberry. Today, the region is heavily managed for logging and recreation, and it is an important water source for lower elevation urban, suburban, and agricultural areas. It is the second-largest of the Cascades subregions, covering 2,729 square miles (7,070 km2) in Oregon and 1,828 square miles (4,734 km2) in Washington.\n\n\nCascade Crest Montane Forest (4c)\nThe Cascade Crest Montane Forest ecoregion consists of an undulating plateau punctuated by volcanic buttes and cones that reach a maximum elevation of about 6,500 feet (2,000 m). Volcanism in the Pliocene epoch overtopped the existing Miocene volcanics of the Western Cascades Montane Highlands. Later, Pleistocene glaciation left numerous rock-basin lakes throughout the plateau. Sinuous, medium gradient streams cross the subdued, glaciated terrain. The region is extensively forested with mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir, and subalpine fir, with some grand fir, noble fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine, and an understory of vine maple, huckleberry, rhododendron, beargrass, twinflower, and wintergreen. Mountain meadows support sedges, dwarf willows, and tufted hairgrass. The region covers 1,909 square miles (4,940 km2) in Oregon and 310 square miles (803 km2) in Washington, running along the spine of the Cascades; an isolated pocket of this ecoregion can be found on Newberry Volcano southeast of Bend.\n\n\nCascades Subalpine/Alpine (4d)\nThe Cascades Subalpine/Alpine ecoregion is an area of high, glaciated, volcanic peaks rising above subalpine meadows, with cascading streams, glacial cirques, and tarns. Pleistocene glaciation reshaped the mountains above 6,500 feet (2,000 m), leaving moraines, glacial lakes, and U-shaped glacial canyons. Glaciers and permanent snowfields still occur on the highest peaks, decreasing from north to south. The vegetation is adapted to high elevations, cold winter temperatures, a short growing season, and a deep winter snow pack. Herbaceous and shrubby subalpine meadow vegetation and scattered patches of mountain hemlock, subalpine fir, and whitebark pine occur near the timberline. Wet meadows support Brewer's sedge, Holm's sedge, black alpine sedge, tufted hairgrass, and alpine aster. Elsewhere, there is bare rock. The region covers 388 square miles (1,000 km2) in Washington and 331 square miles (860 km2) in Oregon and contains many of the prominent volcanic peaks of the high Cascades, including Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Mount Bachelor, Diamond Peak, Mount Scott, and Mount McLoughlin.\n\n\nHigh Southern Cascades Montane Forest (4e)\nThe High Southern Cascades Montane Forest ecoregion is an undulating, glaciated, volcanic plateau punctuated by isolated\nbuttes and cones. Many tarns occur. With an elevation that varies from 4,000 to 8,200 feet (1,200 to 2,500 m), it is an intermediate zone between the Southern Cascades and the Subalpine/Alpine zone. Cryic soils support mixed coniferous forests dominated by mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, and Pacific silver fir; they are colder than the mesic and frigid soils of the Southern Cascades. Grand fir, white fir, and Shasta red fir also occur and become more common toward the south and east. Whitebark pine is found at high elevations. Understory plants include woodrush, Prince's pine, lupine, and sidebells shinleaf. At the highest elevations, open meadows support Shasta buckwheat, Newberry knotweed, and Brewer's sedge. The region tends to be drier than the Cascade Crest Montane Forest, with a longer summer drought and more intermittent streams. The region covers 915 square miles (2,370 km2) in Southern Oregon and includes the lower elevations of Crater Lake National Park.\n\n\nSouthern Cascades (4f)\nThe Southern Cascades ecoregion is lower in elevation and less rugged than the surrounding regions and is characterized by gently sloping mountains and broad valleys. Elevation varies from 1,400 to 5,300 feet (430 to 1,620 m). The climate is drier than other parts of the Cascades, and the vegetation reflects the long summer drought. River and stream discharge are also significantly lower than in systems to the north. Western hemlock and western red cedar, which are indicator species in the Western Cascades ecoregions, decline southward in the Southern Cascades, and are replaced by Sierra Nevada species such as California incense-cedar, white fir, Shasta red fir, and sugar pine, with an understory of snowberry, twinflower, Oregon grape, serviceberry, golden chinkapin, and oceanspray. At lower elevations, Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine are prevalent. The region covers 1,414 square miles (3,660 km2) in Southern Oregon, in the South Umpqua and Rogue River watersheds, separated from the Western Cascades by the Calapooya Divide.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nFlora\n\n\nFauna\n\n\nLandscapes\n\n\nSee also\n\nEcoregions defined by the EPA and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation:\nList of ecoregions in North America (CEC)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (EPA)\nList of ecoregions in Oregon\nList of ecoregions in Washington\nList of ecoregions in California\nThe conservation group World Wildlife Fund maintains an alternate classification system:\nList of ecoregions (WWF)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links", "revid": 1292506955, "rev_timestamp": "2025-05-27T09:19:03Z", "source": "enwiki"}
{"eco_id": 125, "eco_name": "North Victoria Land tundra", "wiki_title": "Tundra of North America", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra_of_North_America", "extract_text": "The Tundra of North America is a Level I ecoregion of North America designated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) in its North American Environmental Atlas.\nOne of the planet's most recent biomes, a result of the last ice age only 10,000 years ago, the tundra contains unique flora and fauna formed during the last glaciation in areas unrestricted by permanent ice. The tundra region is found in high latitudes, primarily in Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland, Iceland, and Scandinavia, as well as the Antarctic Islands. Consisting of the arctic, alpine, and Antarctic regions, and stemming from the Samer language, tundra literally means a \"high and dry place\".\nThe arctic tundra has an exceptionally short growing period, minimal sunlight, and limited resources, creating a brutal environment for plants and animals. By adapting to these harsh conditions, animals and plants represent iconic characteristics of the tundra. Plants grow in aggregated formations which provide shelter from wind, and ice and also improve seed success. Animals have adapted with specialized organs, such as a rete mirabile, an organ that efficiently transfers heat. Frogs and amphibians use \"anti-freeze\" to prevent organ damage while hibernating. Polar bears, foxes, and owls use insulated fur and feathers to protect from the cold conditions. These complex interactions between plants, animals and abiotic factors in the tundra are held together by the permafrost layer, located 450 metres (1,480 ft) under the soil. However climate change is causing this crucial layer of frozen soil to melt. As a result, tundra communities are becoming unstable and basic processes are breaking down. Other factors such as oil development and drilling in tundra ecosystems have completely disheveled the wildlife and vegetation populations. Tundra exploration vehicles used for oil development and polar bear tours (\"an eco-friendly\" industry) leave traces of tire marks for 20-plus years after a disturbance occurs. Other factors such as high CO2 emissions from tourism and from warming tundra soil, create a positive feedback loop, accelerating changes to the tundra.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\n\n\nPlant communities\nThe adversity of soil and climatic conditions proves to low production levels, as well as little biomass accumulation due to slow rates of nutrient release in cold and wet soils, specifically as a result of limited nitrogen and phosphorus (Nadelhoffer et al. 1996) Additionally, there are low temperatures and strong winds in the tundra causing most vegetation to be dominated by woody plants that hug the soil. Within the tundra, some dominant plant species include lichen, cotton grass, and Arctic willow.\n\nLichens dominate the tundra as the region's major primary producer. A symbiotic combination of algae and fungi, a lichen is able to survive in the harsh conditions of the tundra (Biodiversity Institute of Ontario et al. 2010). Their unique structure and survivability make lichen a prominent and keystone plant species in the tundra ecosystem.\nCotton grass is another dominant plant species in the tundra producing much of its growth early in the summer. Being a member of the sedge family, it forms a large part of the vegetation in the tundra because it is able to deal with harsh and cold temperatures. This perennial plant contains flowering heads with dense bristles that are spread during heavy winds, enabling pollination (Wein and Bliss 1974). Additionally, its survivability in the tundra can be attributed to cotton grass's ability to photosynthesize in low temperatures and low light.\nThe Arctic willow, commonly named rock willow, is found in the North American tundra. Most uniquely, the Arctic willow often has long trailing branches that root where they intersect with the surface of the ground, and the roots are shallow as to thrive in the frozen ground of the tundra (Wielgolaski 1972).\nIn addition to species such as lichens, cotton grass, and Arctic willows, shrubs, sedges, lichens, mosses, and vascular plants dominate the tundra plant community (Folch and Camarasa 2000). Despite the tundra eco-region's reputation of being a cold and desolate ‘polar desert’, it is actually a varying landscape supporting a diverse amount of plant and animal species.\n\n\nAnimal species\nSince the tundra has such a harsh environment, the animals who live here have adapted in a way to call the tundra their home. The keystone species of the tundra can be as small as a lemming to as large as a musk ox. The low biodiversity means that fluctuation in individual animals can substantially affect the entire ecosystem. The main predators of the tundra are the polar bear, the Arctic wolf, and the Arctic fox. They all have thick white coats that help them blend into their environment and stalk prey. The polar bear spends the majority of its time out on the ice hunting seals and sometimes when small rodents are scarce on land the Arctic fox will follow the bears and eat their scraps. Wolves use teamwork to attack herds of caribou or musk ox for food. Lemming are small rodents that fluctuate every three to four years and with their fluctuations also comes the fluctuation of their predators such as the Arctic fox and the snowy owl. The keystone herbivores are the musk ox and the caribou. They have thick shaggy coats that they shed during the warmer months. Caribou use their nimble legs to escape quickly from predators while the musk ox uses each other to make a fierce wall of horns. These animals help keep each other alive as well as the ecosystem around them.\n\n\nEndangered species\nThough species have adapted to the harsh climate of the tundra, several species have become endangered due to changing environmental factors. Both plant species and animal species have become endangered. The Aleutian shield fern is a plant species that have been endangered due to caribou tramping and grazing, slumping from growing substrate, and human foot traffic. Animal species that are endangered in the tundra include the Arctic fox, caribou, and polar bears. These animals have been endangered due to overhunting, an infestation of disease, loss of diet and habitat due to climate change, and human destructive activities, such as searches for natural gas and oil, mining, and road building. In an effort to conserve these endangered species, many regulations and standards are being put into action along with establishing the prohibition of unauthorized plant collecting. Standards are being set in regard to mining and mineral exploration. This will help in not disturbing the habitats as much. In addition to this, the protection of caribou grounds has been established along with regulations in regard to the removal of gravel roads for airstrips and road fill, which takes away from many of the animals’ critical territories.\n\n\nGeology, topography and soil\nThe tundra is an extremely harsh, cold, windy, and unique ecosystem found on the extreme north and south latitudes of Earth. The soil consists mostly of frozen permafrost, which makes it difficult for extended root systems to grow, and water to drain and support a wide variety of plant life. This permafrost is also responsible for creating an extremely unusual topography. The land of the tundra is constantly changing as permafrost and snow melts and refreezes through the changing seasons. Land slumps and depressions occur as a result of melting permafrost which takes up less space when the soil was frozen. Depressions that occur as a result of melting permafrost are known as thermokarst, and are often in the form of pits, funnel-shaped sinkholes, valleys, ravines, and sometimes caves. Pingos are another feature of the tundra and can be defined as a cone-shaped hill or mound of soil with a core of ice. Lastly, polygons make up a crucial part of the tundra and are created when two large cracks create a large ice wedge and slowly slump into itself filling with water as heat from sunlight melts the permafrost. Often small lakes are formed from polygons on the surface of the tundra.\nThe flora and fauna must adapt to extremely harsh conditions, however, has been able to do so successfully through evolutionary change. Many threats exist today to the tundra biome including mining, oil drilling, increased habitat loss, human habitations moving farther north, and global warming which is melting more and more permafrost and changing the delicate balance of the soils. It is imperative that we fully understand how our ecosystems function to monitor their stability through the changing climate.\n\n\nClimate\nThe tundra is characterized by a harsh, frost-laden landscape with negative temperatures, a lack of precipitation and nutrients, and extremely short seasons. In the winter it is cold and dark, and in the summer when the snow and the top layer of permafrost melt, it is very soggy and the tundra is covered with marshes, lakes, bogs, and streams. Spring and fall are only short periods between winter and summer. In the peak of winter, average temperatures can reach −30 °F. In arctic regions, there generally is not a great difference between daytime highs and nighttime lows, as the sun generally never rises or simply hangs briefly on the horizon. Summers in the tundra, on the other hand, is very short, in some locations only lasting a few weeks. Daily temperatures can reach up to 60 °F (16 °C) but overnight lows go down into the 30s, 20s, or lower, depending on the region. This results in daily average temperatures coming out to around 50 °F (10 °C). It may rain or snow, and frost still occurs. The average annual temperature is −18 °F. Nights can last for weeks, and when the sun barely rises during some months in the winter, the temperature can drop to −94 °F. During the summer the sun shines almost 24 hours a day. Temperatures can get up to 54 °F (12 °C) but it can get as cold as 37 °F (3 °C). Average summer temperatures range from 37 °F (3 °C) to 60 °F (16 °C). The tundra is very much like a desert in terms of precipitation. Yearly average precipitation varies by region, but generally, there is only about 6–10 inches (150–250 mm) of precipitation per year, and in some regions, it can have up to 20 inches (510 mm). This precipitation usually falls in the form of light, fluffy snow.\nFor more information about the tundra climate, look at this article.\n\n\nEnvironmental threats\nDue to its vulnerable state, the powerful forces of climate change, ozone depletion, air pollution, and construction threaten the tundra's survival. The melting of permafrost increases as a result of global warming, which could drastically alter both the landscape and the biodiversity of the region. The ozone depletion at both the North and South Poles increases the strength of ultraviolet rays that harm the tundra. Air pollution around the world creates smog clouds that contaminate the lichen in the ecosystem, which is a major food source in the region. The construction of pipelines and roads to obtain oil, gas, and minerals cause physical disturbances and habitat fragmentation. There are a number of possible solutions, according to National Geographic, including switching to alternative energy, establishing protected areas and park reserves to restrict human influence, limiting road construction, mining activities, and the building of pipelines in tundra habitat, and limiting tourism and respecting local cultures. The creation of the Arctic National Refuge is an example of a measure being enacted to protect the North American tundra. The Arctic Refuge was originally created in 1960 by the Public Land Order 2214, which was created \"for the purpose of preserving unique wildlife, wilderness, and recreational values\" and \"withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining but not the mineral leasing laws, nor disposals of materials\". In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) re-designated the Range as a part of the larger Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and declared \"that the ‘production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is prohibited and no leasing or other development leading to production of oil and gas from the [Refuge] shall be undertaken until authorized by an act of Congress’\".\n\n\nEffects of climate change\nThe tundra is one of the first places on Earth we have noted the effects of climate change. As an indicator biome, the tundra is a crucial part of the whole global climate system and can help predict the changes the rest of the world will face. The Earth depends on regulating mechanisms and air circulation patterns the tundra provides to keep climates steady worldwide. Human-induced climate change is devastating the tundra because intense complications are present in remote areas, free from human interference. Changes in climate, permafrost, ice pack and glacier formations pose a serious threat to the stability of global climate because these conditions are influenced and reinforced by positive feedback loops. Temperatures in the tundra are rising to the highest temperatures recorded in four centuries and are rising more rapidly than anywhere worldwide The land surfaces in the tundra are no longer reflecting radiation from the sun out of the atmosphere. Soils and open water are absorbing heat from the sun and leading to more warming. Changes in the tundra influence climate change in lower latitudes because air pressure changes are shifting global air and ocean circulation patterns. Sea ice extent in the tundra has reached the lowest recorded levels in centuries and this will dramatically affect people and wildlife worldwide. Changes in climate will be noticed first and seen most intensely in the northern regions of the planet. The tundra will show the effects of climate change the soonest and will hopefully serve as a catalyst for action for people all over the world.\n\n\nNatural resources\nAccording to the US Energy Information Administration, the arctic tundra holds an estimated 13% or 90 billion barrels of the world's undiscovered conventional oil sources. However, there are a number of challenges to oil exploration, drilling, and transportation in an arctic tundra environment that limits the profitability of the venture. Oil and gas fields in the arctic need to be large, with lots of proven reserves, because oil companies need that money to make the investment profitable. Natural gas is a more recoverable resource than oil in tundra eco-regions. It is estimated that there are 221.4 million undiscovered, technically recoverable cubic feet of natural gas in the Arctic. Oil sands, often pejoratively referred to as tar sands, are a phenomenon unique to the tundra environment and are profitable and plentiful in the Athabasca region of the Alberta sands. Oil sands consist of bitumen, which contains petroleum, found in a natural state combined with clays, sands, and water. Oil sands must be heavily processed and refined to yield synthetic crude oil, similar to conventional crude oil. Arctic tundra may contain minerals such as coal, copper, gold, iron, nickel, diamonds, and the base feedstock for uranium oxide called pitchblende.\n\n\nSubregions\n\n\nNorthern Arctic\nBaffin Uplands (ecoregion)\nBanks Island and Amundsen Gulf Lowlands (ecoregion)\nEllesmere Mountains and Eureka Hills (ecoregion)\nFoxe Uplands (ecoregion)\nGulf of Boothia and Foxe Basin Plains (ecoregion)\nLancaster and Borden Peninsula Plateaus (ecoregion)\nParry Islands Plateau (ecoregion)\nSverdrup Islands Lowland (ecoregion)\nVictoria Island Lowlands (ecoregion)\n\n\nAlaska Tundra\nAleutian Islands (ecoregion)\nArctic Coastal Plain (ecoregion)\nArctic Foothills (ecoregion)\nBristol Bay-Nushagak Lowlands (ecoregion)\nSeward Peninsula (ecoregion)\nSubarctic Coastal Plains (ecoregion)\n\n\nBrooks Range Tundra\nBrooks Range/Richardson Mountains (ecoregion)\n\n\nSouthern Arctic\nAberdeen Plains (ecoregion)\nAmundsen Plains (ecoregion)\nCentral Ungava Peninsula and Ottawa and Belcher Islands (ecoregion)\nQueen Maud Gulf and Chantrey Inlet Lowlands (ecoregion)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\"Endangered Animals in the Tundra\". 5 March 2016.

This region overlaps in large part with the North American inland temperate rainforest and gets more rain on average than the South Central Rockies forests and is notable for containing the only inland populations of many species from the Pacific coast.\n\n\nSetting\nThis ecoregion is located in the Rocky Mountain regions of southeastern British Columbia, southwestern Alberta, northwestern Montana, northern Idaho, and northeastern Washington. The climate here is varied. Areas west of the Continental Divide experience greater precipitation and the moderating effects of the Pacific Ocean, while areas east of the Divide experience a drier, more continental climate. In the Canadian portion of the ecoregion, mean annual temperatures range from 3.5 °C (38.3 °F) in the east to 5.5 °C (41.9 °F) west, summer mean temperatures range from 12.5 °C (54.5 °F) to 14.5 °C (58.1 °F), and average winter temperatures range from −3.5 °C (25.7 °F) to −6.5 °C (20.3 °F). Valleys experience warm, wet summers and mildly cold, snowy winters, while subalpine zones experience cool, wet summers with the possibility of frosts, and very cold, snowy winters. Precipitation is moderate to high, with valleys usually receiving between 500 millimetres (20 in) and 800 millimetres (31 in), and high elevations receiving well over 1,000 millimetres (39 in).\n\n\nFlora\nThis ecoregion is predominantly coniferous forest. Lower elevation forests are dominated by Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) and Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), with medium-smaller and mixed populations of Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Rocky mountain douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Western white pine (Pinus monticola), Mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) and Western larch (Larix occidentalis). Subalpine zones are dominated by Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanni), Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and, in areas affected by fire, Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). This ecoregion also contains meadows, foothill grasslands, riverside woodlands, and tree line/alpine zone communities.\n\n\nFauna\nMammals of the North Central Rockies forests include the gray wolf (Canis lupus), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horriblus), wolverine (Gulo gulo), woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), black bear (Ursus americanus cinnamomum), mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemonius), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Rocky Mountain elk ( Cervus canadensis nelson), moose (Alces alces), coyote (Canis latrans), cougar (Puma concolor), bobcat (Lynx rufus),  fisher (Martes pennanti), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), groundhog (Marmota monax) and American marten (Martes americana).\n\n\nConservation status and protected areas\nThough large portions of this ecoregion are intact and protected, its conservation status is listed as \"vulnerable\". The main threats to this ecoregion's integrity are resource extraction and development, increasing human activity, logging, mining, livestock grazing and the introduction of exotic species.\nProtected areas in this ecoregion include Glacier National Park and Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex in northwestern Montana, Yoho and Kootenay National Parks in southeastern British Columbia, Waterton Lakes National Park in far southwestern Alberta and the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness in northeastern Idaho.\n\n\nSee also\nList of ecoregions in Canada (WWF)\nList of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)\nNorth American inland temperate rainforest\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund, ed.

{"eco_id": 212, "eco_name": "Nullarbor Plains xeric shrublands", "wiki_title": "Nullarbor Plain", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullarbor_Plain", "extract_text": "The Nullarbor Plain ( NUL-ər-bor; Latin: nulla feminine of nullus 'no' and arbor 'tree') is part of the area of flat, almost treeless, arid or semi-arid country of southern Australia, located on the Great Australian Bight coast with the Great Victoria Desert to its north. It is the world's largest single exposure of limestone bedrock, and occupies an area of about 200,000 square kilometres (77,000 sq mi). At its widest point, it stretches about 1,100 kilometres (684 mi) from east to west across the border between South Australia and Western Australia.\n\n\nHistory\nHistorically, the Nullarbor was seasonally occupied by Indigenous Australian people, the Mirning clans and Yinyila people. Traditionally, the area was called Oondiri, which is said to mean 'the waterless'.\nThe first Europeans known to have sighted and mapped the Nullarbor coast were Captain François Thijssen and Councillor of the Indies, Pieter Nuyts, on the Dutch East Indiaman 't Gulden Zeepaert (the Golden Seahorse). In 1626–1627, they charted a stretch of the southern Australian coast east of Cape Leeuwin and extending to longitude 133 30'E. While the interior remained little known to Europeans over the next two centuries, the stretch of coast adjoining the Great Australian Bight was named for Nuyts, and maps subsequent to 1627 bore the legend \"Landt van P. Nuyts\" or \"Terre de Nuyts\". That survives as two geographical names in West Australia: Nuytsland Nature Reserve and Nuyts Land District, and in South Australia as Nuyts Reef, Cape Nuyts and the Nuyts Archipelago. \nEdward John Eyre became the first European to successfully cross the Nullarbor (from East to West) in 1841. In writing about Eyre's voyages in 1865, Henry Kingsley wrote that the area across the Nullarbor and Great Australian Bight was a \"hideous anomaly, a blot on the face of Nature, the sort of place one gets into in bad dreams\". Eyre departed westwards from Fowlers Bay on 17 November 1840 with John Baxter and a party of three Aboriginal men. When three of his horses died of dehydration, he returned to Fowler's Bay. He departed with a second expedition on 25 February 1841. By 29 April, the party had reached Caiguna. Lack of supplies and water led to a mutiny. Two of the Aboriginal men killed Baxter and took the party's supplies. Eyre and the third Aboriginal man, Wylie, continued on their journey, surviving through bushcraft and some fortuitous circumstances such as receiving some supplies from a French whaling vessel anchored at Rossiter Bay, some 36 kilometres (22 mi) east of Esperance. They completed their journey in Albany in June 1841.\nIn August 1865, while travelling across the Nullarbor Plain, Edmund Delisser in his journal named both Nullarbor and Eucla for the first time.\nA proposed new state of Auralia (meaning \"land of gold\") would have comprised the Goldfields, the western portion of the Nullarbor Plain and the port town of Esperance. Its capital would have been Kalgoorlie.\nDuring the British nuclear tests at Maralinga in the 1950s, the Australian Government removed the Wangai people from their homeland. Since then, they have been awarded compensation, and many have returned to the general area. Others never left.\nSome agricultural interests are on the fringe of the plain including the 2.5-million-acre (1-million-hectare) Rawlinna Station, the largest sheep station in the world, on the Western Australian side of the plain. The property has a short history compared to other properties of its type around Australia, having been established in 1962 by Hugh G. MacLachlan, of the South Australian pastoral family. An older property is Madura Station, situated closer to the coast; it has a size of 1.7 million acres (690,000 ha) and is also stocked with sheep. Madura was established prior to 1927; the extent of the property at that time was reported as two million acres (810,000 hectares).\nIn 2013, a huge area of the Nullarbor Plain, stretching almost 200 km (120 mi) from the Western Australian border to the Great Australian Bight, was proclaimed as the Nullarbor Wilderness Protection Area under the Wilderness Protection Act 1992 (SA), doubling the area of land in South Australia under environmental protection to 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres). The area contains 390 species of plants and a large number of habitats for rare species of animals and birds.\n\n\nGeology and geography\nThe Nullarbor Plain is a former shallow seabed, as indicated by the presence of bryozoans, foraminifera, echinoids and red algae calcareous skeletons that make up the limestone. The region is also the location of \"Nullarbor limestone\" and it has a reputation as a significant karst region with Oligocene and Miocene cave formations.\nThe sequence within the limestone includes five formations:\n\nthe upper formation is the Nullarbor Limestone which is early middle Miocene in age;\nthe Mullamullang member of this formation is a paraconforming member, being separated by 5 million years;\nthe third member is the Abrakurrie Limestone that was formed in a central depression of the earlier formation; this is late Oligocene to Early Miocene in age and does not reach the edge of the plain;\nthe last two formations are conforming formations; the late Eocene Toolinna Limestone lies on the Wilsons Bluff Limestone which is mid- to late Eocene in age; and\nthe Toolinna Limestone does not cover the whole Nullarbor and is extant only in the extreme east beside the Abrakurrie formation which lies in a depression.\nOne theory is that the whole area was uplifted by crustal movements in the Miocene, and since then, erosion by wind and rain has reduced its thickness. The plain has most likely never had any major defining topographic features, resulting in the extremely flat terrain across the plain today.\n\nAccording to Curtin University research published in 2023, \"Nullarbor drastically shifted to dry conditions between 2.4 and 2.7 million years ago\". \nIn areas, the southern ocean blows through many caves, resulting in blowholes up to several hundred metres from the coast. The Murrawijinie Cave in South Australia is open to the public, but most of the Nullarbor Caves on the Western Australian side can only be visited and viewed with a permit from the Department of Parks and Wildlife.\nThe Nullarbor is known for extensive meteorite deposits, which are extremely well preserved in the arid climate. In particular, many meteorites have been discovered around Mundrabilla, some up to several tonnes in weight.\nAccording to the USDA soil taxonomy system, the Nullarbor's soils are classified as mainly consisting of aridisols.\n\n\nLimits\nFrequently The Nullarbor is expanded in tourist literature and web-based material to loosely refer to all the land between Adelaide, South Australia and Perth, Western Australia. Through observing satellite images, the limits of the limestone formation of the plain can be seen to stretch from approximately 20 km (12 mi) west of the original Balladonia settlement (now abandoned) to its easternmost limit a few kilometres west of the town of Ceduna.\n\n\nClimate\n\nThe Nullarbor includes desert and semi-arid climate zones. Updated versions of the Köppen climate classifications, the plain most closely fits the Köppen BWk \"cold desert\" and BSk \"cold semi-arid\" taxons (rather than the BWh \"hot desert\" type found in central Australia). While summer days can be scorching hot, with daytime temperatures close to 50 °C (122 °F), in winter nights frequently drop well below freezing. Close to the coast, temperatures are more moderate and more rain falls in the winter months, compared to the most inland parts of Australia. The mean annual rainfall at Cook is 184.1 millimetres (7.25 in), with most rain falling between May and August. Summers are very dry, with rain falling mainly from sporadic storms; however, occasionally decaying tropical systems can cause heavier rain in the summer months. Temperatures on the plain have ranged from 49.9 °C (121.8 °F) at the like-named Nullarbor, South Australia which is the fourth hottest recorded temperature (and the hottest recorded December temperature) in all of Australia, to −7.2 °C (19.0 °F) at Eyre, which is the coldest recorded temperature in Western Australia.\n\n\nBiogeography\nThe Nullarbor Plain constitutes a deserts and xeric shrublands ecoregion, called the Nullarbor Plains xeric shrublands by the World Wildlife Fund. The ecoregion is coterminous with the Nullarbor biogeographic region under the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA). The ecoregion is bounded on the west and southwest by the Coolgardie woodlands ecoregion, on the north and northeast by the Great Victoria Desert, on the southeast by the Eyre and Yorke mallee, and on the south by the Great Australian Bight.\n\n\nFlora\nVegetation in the area is primarily low saltbush (Atriplex spp.) and bluebush (Maireana spp.) scrub.\n\n\nFauna\nThe fauna of the Nullarbor includes communities of crustaceans, spiders, and beetles adapted to the darkness of the Nullarbor Caves and the underground rivers and lakes that run through them. Mammals of the desert include the southern hairy-nosed wombat, which shelters from the hot sun by burrowing into the sands, as well as typical desert animals such as red kangaroos and dingoes. An elusive subspecies of the Australian masked owl unique to the Nullarbor is known to roost in the many caves on the plain. The grasslands of the Nullarbor are suitable for some sheep grazing and are also damaged by rabbits. The caves provide roosts to large colonies of wattled microbats, species Chalinolobus morio.\n\n\nProtected areas\nA 2017 assessment found that 62,317 km2, or 32%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include:\n\nGreat Victoria Desert Nature Reserve\nNullarbor National Park, a protected area in South Australia\nNullarbor Regional Reserve, a protected area in South Australia\nNullarbor Wilderness Protection Area, a protected area in South Australia\n\n\nCommunications and transport\n\n\nTelegraph\nThe need for a communications link across the continent was the spur for the development of an east–west crossing. Once Eyre had proved that a link between South Australia and Western Australia was possible, efforts to connect them via telegraph began. In 1877, after two years of labour, the first messages were sent on the new telegraph line, boosted by eight repeater stations along the way. The line operated for about 50 years before being superseded, and remnants of it remain visible.\n\n\nRailway line\nThe Trans-Australian Railway railway line crosses the Nullarbor Plain from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. Construction of the line began in 1917, when two teams set out from Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, meeting in the centre of the plain at Ooldea, an uninhabited area noted for a water supply. This original line suffered severe problems with track flexing and settling in the desert sands, and journeys across the Plain were slow and arduous. The line was entirely rebuilt in 1969, as part of a project to standardise the previously disparate rail gauges in the various states, and the first crossing of the Nullarbor on the new line reached Perth on 27 February 1970. The Indian Pacific is a weekly passenger train crossing the Nullarbor from Perth to Sydney via Adelaide.\nThe railway line has the longest straight section of railway in the world (478 km; 297 mi), while the Eyre Highway (refer below) contains the longest straight section of tarred road in Australia (146 km; 91 mi).\nMost of the inhabited areas of the Nullarbor Plain can be found in a series of small settlements located along the railway, and in small settlements along the Eyre Highway that provide services to travellers, mostly spaced between one and two hundred kilometres apart. The town of Cook, South Australia, was formerly a moderately thriving settlement of about 40 people, with a school and a golf course. The reduction of railway operations at the town resulted in its virtual desertion, and it now has a permanent population of four. The Tea & Sugar operated until 1996, supplying provisions to the town along the railway line.\n\n\nRoad\n\nThe Eyre Highway, which connects Norseman in Western Australia to Port Augusta, was carved across the continent in 1941. At first it was little more than a rough track but was gradually sealed over the next thirty years. The last unsealed section of the Eyre Highway was finally sealed in 1976. Unlike the railway, though, it crosses the plain at its southernmost edge rather than through the centre.\nThe unsealed Trans Access Road closely follows the Trans-Australian Railway, running all the way from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta and onward. It services the numerous cattle and sheep stations that populate the Western side of the Nullarbor and affords access to rail maintenance teams. It is a brutally rough road and—despite the amount of traffic it carries—is poorly maintained.\n\n\nCultural significance\n\nThe Nullarbor represents the boundary between eastern and western Australia, regardless of the travel method. The press might write that a prime minister who visits Perth has \"headed across the Nullarbor\". \"Crossing the Nullarbor\", for many Australians, is a quintessential experience of the \"Australian Outback\". Stickers bought from roadhouses on the highway show \"I have crossed the Nullarbor\", and can be seen on vehicles of varying quality or capacity for long-distance travel. The process of \"beating the crowds\" on overbooked and overpriced air services at the time of special sporting events can also see significant numbers of vehicles on the road.\nCrossing the Nullarbor in the 1950s and earlier was a significant achievement, as most of the route then was a dirt track of variable quality, and presenting real hazards to the motorist. It presented one of the major challenges in Round-Australia car trials (the Redex and Ampol Trials) and gave photographers many opportunities for shots of daring driving and motoring misfortune.\nThe Nullarbor features in the Australian 1981 thriller film Roadgames. The film was directed by Richard Franklin and starred Stacy Keach and Jamie Lee Curtis. The film has often been cited as one of the best Hitchcock films Alfred Hitchcock never made.\n\n\nNotable crossings and records\n\n\nOn bicycles\nOn 25 December 1896, after an arduous journey of thirty-one days, Arthur Charles Jeston Richardson became the first cyclist to cross the Nullarbor Plain, pedaling his bicycle from Coolgardie to Adelaide. Carrying only a small kit and a waterbag, he followed the telegraph line as he crossed the Nullarbor. He later described the heat as \"1,000 degrees in the shade\".\nIn 1937 Hubert Opperman set a record fastest time of 13 days, 10 hours and 11 minutes for the transcontinental crossing from Fremantle to Sydney. His time cut five days off the previous record.\nDuring their three-year cycling trip around Australia between 1946 and 1949, Wendy Law Suart and Shirley Duncan became the first women to cycle across the Plain.\nBetween 29 June and 3 July 2015, brothers Tyron and Aaron Bicknell recorded the fastest-known crossing of the Nullarbor Plain on single speed bicycles. Their ride took advantage of the low temperatures in the Australian winter months and was completed over 4 days, 5 hours and 21 minutes, making it one of the fastest bicycle crossings and the fastest done with a single-geared bike.\nIn January 2017, Austrian cyclist Christoph Strasser set the current record from Norseman to Ceduna of 1 day, 21 hours, 42 minutes.\n\n\nOn foot\n\nThe first non-Indigenous person to walk across Australia from the west to the east coast, Henri Gilbert, crossed the Nullarbor Plain on foot, with no support team or stock, in the middle of summer. His walk across Australia, from Fremantle to Brisbane, was achieved between August 1897 and December 1898.\nFor two winter months in 1985, six young Jesus Christians walked 1600 kilometres (1000 miles) from Port Augusta to Norseman without taking any food, water, additional clothing or a support vehicle- although supplies were given to them by passing motorists.\nIn 1998, runner Robert Garside ran across the Nullarbor without a formal support crew, as part of an authenticated run around the world. Unconventionally, Garside obtained water and other support from \"passing traffic\" who would leave water cached ahead for him at agreed drop-offs, to achieve the feat. In 2010, columnist Dan Koeppel ran the 200 mi (320 km) heart of the Nullarbor with a friend the same way, to vindicate Garside. Garside commented in his diary, that \"the key to running the Nullarbor turned out to be Australian hospitality\", and Koeppel concurred that \"[F]rom an armchair it is completely impossible to run the Nullarbor. Once you're out there, however, there is a way. Robert Garside discovered it. So would I\".\n\n\nSee also\nBunda Cliffs\nNullarbor Links golf course\nNullarbor Nymph, a hoax perpetrated in Australia between 1971 and 1972 that involved supposed sightings of a half-naked woman living amongst kangaroos on the Plain\nNullarbor, South Australia, a locality within the Nullarbor Plain in South Australia\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nBolam, A.

{"eco_id": 578, "eco_name": "Patagonian steppe", "wiki_title": "Patagonian Desert", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_Desert", "extract_text": "The Patagonian Desert, also known as the Patagonian Steppe, is the largest desert in Argentina and is the eighth-largest desert in the world by area, occupying approx. 673,000 square kilometres (260,000 mi2). It is located primarily in Argentina and is bounded by the Andes, to its west, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east, in the region of Patagonia, southern Argentina and areas of Chile. To the north the desert grades into the Cuyo Region and the Monte. The central parts of the steppe are dominated by shrubby and herbaceous plant species albeit to the west, where precipitation is higher, bushes are replaced by grasses. Topographically the deserts consist of alternating tablelands and massifs dissected by river valleys and canyons. The more western parts of the steppe host lakes of glacial origin and grades into barren mountains or cold temperate forests along valleys.\nInhabited by hunter-gatherers since Pre-Hispanic times, the desert faced migration in the 19th century of Argentines, Welsh, and other European peoples, transforming it from a conflictive borderland zone to an integral part of Argentina, with cattle, sheep and horse husbandry being the primary land uses.\nThe Patagonian Desert has existed since the Middle Miocene (14–12 million years ago) and came into existence as the Andes rose to the west.\n\n\nGeography and climate\n\nThe Patagonian Desert is the largest desert south of the 40° parallel and is a large cold winter desert, where the temperature rarely exceeds 12 °C and averages just 3 °C. The region experiences about seven months of winter and five months of summer. Frost is not uncommon in the desert but, due to the very dry condition year round, snow is rare.  The Andes, to the desert's west, are the primary reason for the Patagonian desert status as they inhibit the westerly flow of moisture from the southern Pacific from reaching inland. This creates a rain shadow that accounts for the formation of the desert and is why, despite approximately half of the desert being only about 200 miles from the ocean, such a large desert is found in the region. The cold Falkland Current off the Atlantic coast of South America also contributes to the area's aridity.\nDifferent climates can be distinguished: the coast north of the 45th parallel is much milder because of the warm currents from Brazil, and the entire northern half of the region is significantly warmer in the summer, when sunny weather predominates. Daily temperatures in the summer reach 31 °C in the Rio Colorado region, a general 26 °C to 29 °C in the northern coast, and 24 °C to 28 °C in the northern plain, with nights around 12 °C to 15 °C in the coast and between 7 °C and 10 °C in the steppe.\nIn the south, summer temperatures decrease from 22 °C to only 16 °C along the coast, and from 24 °C to 17 °C along the steppes, while nights go from 8 °C to 11 °C on the coast, and from 6 °C to 10 °C in the steppe.\nDuring the winter, the proximity to the coast and the altitude are the main factors: while northern coastal areas have mild winters, from 2 °C at night to about 11 °C during the day, southern Santa Cruz ranges from -2 °C to 5 °C, and Tierra del Fuego, from -3 °C to 3 °C, for a mean of 0 °C.\nInland, the northern areas range from 0 °C to 10 °C in low areas, and from -5 °C to 5 °C on the plateaus (again, mean around 0 °C), while in the south, low areas range from -3 °C to 4 °C, and higher areas are clearly below 0 °C. The coldest spots usually register temperatures between -20 °C and -25 °C during cold waves, and the official record is -33.9 °C in Chubut province. However, some towns claim to have had records of around -35 °C.\nSummer frost is common everywhere except for the northern coast, and even sleet and light snow can fall during the warm season. Winds are constant and very strong, from the west in most cases.\n\nBefore the Andes were formed, the region was likely covered by temperate forests. However, after the formation of the Andes, ash from nearby volcanoes covered the forests and mineral-saturated waters seeped into the logs, thus fossilizing the trees and creating one of the world's best preserved petrified forests in the desert's center. The Patagonian is mainly composed of gravel plains and plateaus with sandstone canyons and clay shapes dotting the landscape, sculpted by the desert wind. The region encompassing the desert, however, has many diverse features. Ephemeral rivers, lakes, and drainage deposits from the Andes' spring melt form annually, hosting a variety of waterfowl and aquatic grasses. A variety of glacial, fluvial, and volcanic deposits are also found in the region and have significantly affected the desert's climate over time, especially contributing to the gravel sediments covering parts of the Patagonian.\nThe desert is quite windy as well, a result of the rain shadow effect and descending cool mountain air. This wind helps make the Patagonian one of the largest sources of dust over the South Atlantic Ocean.\nOn the west, the Patagonian grasslands portion of the Patagonian Desert are bounded by nothofagus forests of the Magellanic subpolar forests.\nVolcanic rocks covers more than 120,000 km2 of the Patagonian Desert, mainly in the Somún Cura Massif (i.e. North Patagonian Massif) and the Deseado Massif. Some other volcanic areas include the Pali-Aike Volcanic Field near the Strait of Magellan. The volcanic rocks are the result of back-arc volcanism distributed mainly in two episodes: one in the Eocene and Miocene and the other from Late Miocene to Pleistocene.\n\n\nFauna and flora\n\nDespite the harsh desert environment, a number of animals venture into and live in the Patagonian. Some only live on the more habitable and geographically-varied outskirts of the desert, where food is more abundant and the environment less hostile, but all are found within the region encompassing the Patagonian. The burrowing owl, lesser rhea, guanaco, tuco-tuco, mara, pygmy armadillo, Patagonian weasel, puma, Patagonian gray fox, desert iguana, western ribbon snake, and various species of eagle and hawk are a few of the variety of animals living in the region.\nThe flora of the region is quite common for its climate and includes several species of desert shrubs like Acantholippia and Benthamiella and tuft grasses like Stipa and Poa. Aquatic grasses and larger flora exist on the outskirts of the desert and around the ephemeral lakes that form from the Andes' runoff.\n\n\nHuman land use\n\nThe desert has hosted various indigenous peoples in its past, as evidenced by cave paintings in the area. The earliest inhabitants of the desert known by name are those of the Tehuelche complex. Tehuelches lived as hunter-gatherers and did not practise agriculture in lush valleys found in the desert. In the 18th and 19th centuries the northern part of the desert came under Mapuche influence during a process of Araucanization. Mapuches came to practise horse husbandry in the northern part of the Patagonian steppe. Mapuche tribes came to control trade across the desert and traded with the cities of southern Chile as well as Buenos Aires and the Cuyo Region.\nFrom the mid-19th century onwards several Argentine and European settlements, some of them sporadic, appeared at the edges of the desert. The most important was established at Chubut River's outflow by Welsh immigrants in 1860. Perito Moreno explored the desert in the 1870s. In the 1870s the Argentine army undertook the Conquest of the Desert campaign, massively defeating Mapuche warlords. The Conquest of the Desert was followed by a sharp decline in the indigenous population of the desert; some were chased into Chile and peripheral areas in the Andes. It is estimated that the Conquest of the Desert caused the death of about 1,000 Native Americans. Additionally 10,000 Native Americans were taken prisoner of whom 3,000 ended up in Buenos Aires separated by sexes to avoid their procreation. The boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina bought most of the desert under definitive Argentine sovereignty; previously Chile had claimed varying now Argentine areas under claims of inherited colonial titles.\nIn the few decades before and after 1900 the less dry parts of the Patagonian steppe experienced a sheep farming boom, transforming the region into one of the world's greatest exporters of ovine products.\nThe area is sparsely populated today and those that do live here survive mainly by the raising of livestock such as sheep and goats. Resource mining, especially of oil, gas, and coal in parts of the region, is another way humans interact with and influence the desert environment.\n\n\nProtected areas\nA 2017 assessment found that 70,970 km2, or 12%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include:\n\nBernardo O'Higgins National Park\nCerro Castillo National Park\nBosques Petrificados de Jaramillo National Park\nEl Rincón Wilderness Nature Reserve\nKawésqar National Park\nLa Ascensión Wilderness Nature Reserve\nLaguna Blanca National Park\nLaguna del Diamante Nature Reserve\nLaguna San Rafael National Park\nLanín National Park\nLeicester Falls Nature Reserve\nLos Glaciares National Park\nMonte León National Park\nPali Aike National Park\nPatagonia National Park (Argentina)\nPatagonia National Park (Chile)\nPatagonia Wilderness Nature Reserve\nPerito Moreno National Park\nSea Lion Island Nature Reserve\nValdes Biosphere Reserve\n\n\nSee also\nDesert\nConquest of the Desert\nMagallanes Region\nGreat American Desert\nCold desert climates\nCold semi-arid climates\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Patagonian Steppe\".

It stretches from the northern shores of the Black Sea (the Pontus Euxinus of antiquity) to the northern area around the Caspian Sea, where it ends at the Ural-Caspian narrowing, which joins it with the Kazakh Steppe in Central Asia, making it a part of the larger Eurasian Steppe. Geopolitically, the Pontic–Caspian Steppe extends from northeastern Bulgaria and southeastern Romania through Moldova, southern and eastern Ukraine, through the North Caucasus of southern Russia, and into the Lower Volga region where it straddles the border of southern Russia and western Kazakhstan. Biogeographically, it is a part of the Palearctic realm, and of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome.\nThe area corresponds to Cimmeria, Scythia, and Sarmatia of classical antiquity. Across several millennia, numerous tribes of nomadic horsemen used the steppe; many of them went on to conquer lands in the settled regions of Central and Eastern Europe, West Asia, and South Asia.\nIn biogeography, the term Ponto-Caspian region refers to the distinctive plant and animal life of these steppes, covering species that are native to the surrounding waters of the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Azov Sea. Genetic research has identified this region as the most probable place where horses were first domesticated.\nThe Kurgan hypothesis, the most prevalent theory in Indo-European studies, posits that the Pontic–Caspian steppe was the homeland of the speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language.\n\n\nGeography and ecology\n\nThe Pontic–Caspian steppe covers an area of 994,000 km2 (384,000 sq mi) of Central and Eastern Europe, that extends from northeastern Bulgaria and southeastern Romania, through Moldova, and southern and eastern Ukraine, through the Northern Caucasus of southern Russia, and into the Lower Volga region of western Kazakhstan, to the east of the Ural Mountains. The steppe is bounded by the East European forest steppe to the north, a transitional zone of mixed grasslands and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests.\nTo the south, the steppe extends to the Black Sea, except the Crimean and western Caucasus mountains' border with the sea, where the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex defines the southern edge of the steppes. The steppe extends to the western shore of the Caspian Sea in the Dagestan region of Russia, but the drier Caspian lowland desert lies between the steppe and the northwestern and northern shores of the Caspian. The Kazakh Steppe bounds the steppe to the east.\nThe Ponto-Caspian seas are the remains of the Turgai Sea, an extension of the Paratethys which extended south and east of the Urals and covering much of today's West Siberian Plain in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.\n\n\nPrehistoric cultures\n\nInnumerable tribes, cultures, nations, kingdoms, empires, etc. had origins in Pontic Caspian Steppes including:\n\nLinear Pottery culture 5500–4500 BCE\nCucuteni-Trypillian culture 5300–2600 BCE\nKhvalynsk culture 5000–3500 BCE\nSredny Stog culture 4500–3500 BCE\nMaykop culture 3700–3000 BCE\nMykhailivka culture 3600—3000 BCE\nYamnaya/Kurgan cultures 3500–2300 BCE\nKura-Araxes culture 3000–2000 BCE\nCatacomb culture 3000–2200 BCE\nSrubna culture 1600–1200 BCE\nKoban culture 1100–400 BCE\nNovocherkassk culture 900–650 BCE\n\n\nHistorical peoples and nations\n\nInnumerable tribes, cultures, nations, kingdoms, empires, etc. had origins in the Pontic Caspian Steppes including:\n\nIndo-Europeans 4th millennium BCE – now\nCimmerians 12th–7th centuries BCE\nDacians and Thracians (Getae) 11th century BCE – 3rd century CE\nScythians 8th–4th centuries BCE\nSarmatians 5th century BCE – 5th century CE\nOstrogoths 3rd–6th centuries\nHuns and Avars 4th–8th centuries\nBulgars, Onogurs, and Bulgarians 4th–21st centuries:\nGreat Bulgaria 7th century\nFirst Bulgarian Empire 7th–11th centuries\nSecond Bulgarian Empire 12th–15th centuries\nPrincipality of Karvuna\nAlans 5th–11th centuries\nEurasian Avars 6th–8th centuries\nGöktürks 6th–8th centuries\nSabirs 6th–8th centuries\nKhazars 6th–11th centuries\nMagyar tribes (Hungarians) 7th–9th centuries attested but probably from earlier\nRus' people (Kievan Rus') 8th–13th centuries\nPechenegs 8th–11th centuries\nKipchaks and Cumans 11th–13th centuries\nTurkic Golden Horde 13th–15th centuries\nCossacks, Kalmyks, Crimean Khanate, Volga Tatars, Nogais, and other Turkic states and tribes 15th–18th centuries\nRussian Empire 16th–20th centuries\nMountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus 19th–20th centuries\nSoviet Union 20th century\nUkraine, Moldova, Southern Russia, Kazakhstan 21st century\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Pontic steppe\".

{"eco_id": 174, "eco_name": "Rakiura Island temperate forests", "wiki_title": "Stewart Island", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island", "extract_text": "Stewart Island (Māori: Rakiura, lit. 'glowing skies', officially Stewart Island / Rakiura, formerly New Leinster) is the third-largest and southernmost inhabited island of New Zealand, lying 30 kilometres (16 nautical miles) south of the South Island, separated by Foveaux Strait.\nIt is a roughly triangular island with a land area of 1,746 km2 (674 sq mi). Its 164-kilometre (102 mi) coastline is indented by Paterson Inlet (east), Port Pegasus (south), and Mason Bay (west). The island is generally hilly (rising to 980 metres or 3,220 feet at Mount Anglem) and densely forested.  Almost all the island is owned by the New Zealand government, and over 80 percent of the island forms Rakiura National Park.\nStewart Island's economy depends on fishing and summer tourism. Its permanent population was recorded at 408 people in the 2018 census. Most residents live in the settlement of Oban on the eastern side of the island. Ferries connect Oban to Bluff in the South Island. Stewart Island is part of the Southland District for local government purposes.\n\n\nHistory and naming\n\nArchaeology indicates that the island was settled in the 14th century, shortly after the Māori settled in the South Island.\nThe original Māori name, Te Punga o Te Waka a Māui, means \"The Anchor Stone of Māui’s Canoe\". This refers to the legend of Māui and his crew, who from their canoe Te Waka a Māui (the South Island), caught and raised the great fish Te Ika a Māui, the North Island.\nThe more common Māori name, Rakiura, is usually translated as \"glowing skies\" in reference to the aurora australis.\nFor some, Rakiura is the abbreviated version of Te Rakiura a Te Rakitamau, translated as \"great blush of Rakitamau\", in reference to the latter's embarrassment when refused the hand in marriage of not one but two daughters of an island chief.\nJames Cook saw the insularity of Stewart Island during his first Pacific Voyage in 1770. After five days of sailing south/clockwise around the island, Endeavour stood at the western entrance of Foveaux Strait. Looking east through the wide Strait, the crew could see Ruapuke Island which they had passed 5 days earlier, guarding the eastern entrance of the Strait. Cook wrote: “there appear’d an open Channel … we saw the small island we were in with on the 6th instant”. Zachary Hicks wrote: “this is ye Western opening of the Passage mentioned the 6 Ins.” Nonetheless, Cook knew that an offshore island was strategically valuable to Britain’s rivals and should be hidden as a matter of military policy. He tried to erase his description of Foveaux Strait from his journal and drew a revised chart attaching the island to the mainland, turning Stewart Island into a peninsula.\nLike Beaglehole, another New Zealand historian, Robert McNab, was shocked by this. Neither could conceive that Cook and the Admiralty would engage in strategic disinformation/cartographic secrecy. McNab writes: “Unless given us in Cook’s own words, it would be incredible that he could have made such a mistake.\". However, G. A. Mawer argues that Cook was simply unsure whether it was an island because his focus was on finding the southern extent of New Zealand, and conditions were unfavourable for more closely exploring a possible strait.\nThe strait was first charted by Owen Folger Smith, a New Yorker who had been in Sydney Harbour with Eber Bunker, from whom he probably learned of the eastern seal hunting. Smith charted the strait in the whaleboat of the sealing brig Union (out of New York) in 1804 and on his 1806 chart, it was called Smith's Straits.\nThe island received its English name in honour of William W. Stewart. He was first officer on the Pegasus, which visited in 1809, and he charted the large south-eastern harbour that now bears the ship's name (Port Pegasus) and determined the northern points of the island, proving that it was an island. In 1824, he initiated plans in England to establish a timber, flax and trading settlement at Stewart Island and sailed there in 1826.\nIn 1841, the island was established as one of the three Provinces of New Zealand and was named New Leinster. However, the province existed on paper only and was abolished after only five years. With the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1846, the island became part of New Munster, which entirely included the South Island. When New Munster was abolished in 1853, Stewart Island became part of Otago Province until 1861, when Southland Province split from Otago. In 1876, the provinces were abolished altogether.\nFor most of the twentieth century, \"Stewart Island\" was the official name, and the most commonly used. The name was officially altered to Stewart Island/Rakiura by the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, one of many such changes under the Ngāi Tahu treaty settlement.\n\n\nGeography\n\nStewart Island has an area of 1,680 square kilometres (650 sq mi). The highest point is Mount Anglem, at 980 metres (3,215 ft) above sea level, located close to the island's north coast. Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the official name of the peak was altered to Mount Anglem / Hananui. \nThe southern half is more uniformly undulating, rising to a ridge that runs south from the valley of the Rakeahua River, which also flows into Paterson Inlet. The southernmost point in this ridge is Mount Allen, at 750 metres (2,460 ft). Notable twin rock formations in this region are granite domes  known as Gog and Magog. \nMason Bay, on the west side, is notable for being long and sandy. One suggestion is that the bay was formed in the aftershock of a meteorite impact in the Tasman Sea; however, no evidence has been found to support such a claim.\nApproximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were 100 m (330 ft) lower than present day levels, Stewart Island and its surrounding islands were connected to the rest of New Zealand. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, eventually separating Stewart Island from the mainland.\nThere are several large and many small islands around the coast. Codfish Island / Whenua Hou is an island nature reserve of 1,396 ha (3,450 acres) located 3 km (1.9 mi) west of Stewart Island, known as a protected habitat for kākāpō. Ulva Island is within Paterson Inlet, and is a 267 ha (660 acres) sanctuary for native species. It is open to the public and is maintained free of introduced pest animals.\nThree groups of small islands around the north-east and south-west coasts of Stewart Island are known collectively as the Tītī / Muttonbird Islands. These are the locations for the traditional seasonal harvesting (muttonbirding) of sooty shearwater chicks by Rakiura Māori. The largest of these islands is Taukihepa / Big South Cape Island.\n\n\nSettlements\n\nThe only town is Oban, on Halfmoon Bay.\n\n\nGeology\nGeologically, Stewart Island is made up of rocks from the Median Batholith. The island is mostly composed of granite, particularly the southern two thirds of the island. The northern third (north of the Freshwater Valley Fault) is composed of Anglem Complex diorites, minor gabbro and granite, and many pegmatites. The Freshwater Valley Fault in between is mainly alluvium and volcanic sediments.\n\n\nRivers\n\nThere is a variety of types of watercourse on Stewart Island as a result of the moderate to high rainfall and the wide variations in landform and soil types. They range from lowland rivers such as the Rakeahua and Freshwater rivers, to short and steep streams in the coastal northwest.\nFreshwater River is the longest river on Stewart Island. It is navigable at high tide from Paterson Inlet and is used by water taxi services to transport walkers to Freshwater Landing, at the junction of the Southern Circuit and Northwest Circuit walking tracks. The tributaries are on the southern slopes of Mount Anglem and the eastern slopes of the Ruggedy Mountain area. In its lower reaches the river flows through a basin that comprises the majority of the flat land on Stewart Island. The Freshwater River valley contains the southernmost kahikatea forest in New Zealand.\n\n\nRakiura National Park\n\nRakiura National Park is the 14th of New Zealand's national parks and was officially opened on 9 March 2002. The park covers close to 1,400 square kilometres (540 sq mi), which is about 85% of the area of Stewart Island / Rakiura. The area of the park excludes the township around Halfmoon Bay (Oban) and some roads as well as private or Māori-owned land further inland.\n\n\nClimate\nStewart Island has a temperate climate. However, one travel guide mentions \"frequent downpours that make 'boots and waterproof clothing mandatory\", and another guide says that rainfall in Oban, the principal settlement, is 1,600 to 1,800 mm (63 to 71 in) a year.\n\n\nDemographics\nStewart Island covers 1,747.72 km2 (674.80 sq mi) including the offshore islands, the most sizeable being Ruapuke Island, Codfish Island / Whenua Hou and Taukihepa / Big South Cape Island. It had an estimated population of 500 as of June 2025, with a population density of 0.29 people per km2.\n\nStewart Island had a population of 408 at the 2018 New Zealand census.\nOf those at least 15 years old, 84 (23.7%) people had a bachelor's or higher degree, and 63 (17.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $33,500, compared with $31,800 nationally. 57 people (16.1%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 207 (58.5%) people were employed full-time, 54 (15.3%) were part-time, and 3 (0.8%) were unemployed.\nIn the 2018 census ethnicities were recorded as being: 93.4% European, 19.9% Māori, 1.5% Pasifika, 0.7% Asian, and 2.2% other ethnicities.\n\n\nEcology\n\n\nFlora\nNoeline Baker purchased land near Halfmoon Bay in the early 1930s and with a checklist by botanist Leonard Cockayne populated it with all the local indigenous plants. She gave the land and her house to the government in 1940, and today Moturau Moana is New Zealand's southernmost public garden.\n\n\nFauna\nThere are many species of birds on Stewart Island that have been able to continue to thrive because of the absence of the stoats, ferrets, and weasels that humans brought to the main islands. There are even more species of birds, including huge colonies of sooty shearwater and other seabirds, on The Snares and the other smaller islands offshore. The birds of Stewart Island include weka, kākā, albatross, the flightless Stewart Island kiwi, silvereyes, fantails, and kererū. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin has a significant number of breeding sites here. The South Island giant moa (Dinornis robustus) occurred on the island, subfossil remains having been retrieved in its dunes.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nAs the island has always been sparsely populated and there has never been very much logging, much of the original wildlife is intact, including species that have been devastated on the mainland post-colonisation. However, although habitats and wildlife were not threatened by invasive species historically, now there are populations of brushtail possums, feral cats, hedgehogs and three species of rats. Mice arrive on the island, but are not known to have established a population, and there are no mustelids. There is a large population of white-tailed deer, which were introduced to coastal areas and are hunted for meat and sport. There is also a small population of red deer, confined to the inland areas.\nRabbits were introduced to the island in 1943 which later became a pest after rapid multiplication.\nIn February 2025, the Department of Conservation (DOC) announced a pest eradication project on the island.   The project, part of the Island-Ocean Connection Challenge (IOCC), targets three islands up to 15 times larger than any previously cleared of pests in New Zealand.  The goal is to remove invasive species, restore ecosystems, and protect native wildlife, including kākāpō, seabirds, and rare plants. The total project cost is estimated at $202 million, with $54 million from the government and $11.5 million raised through philanthropy, leaving $137 million still needed.\n\n\nInternational Dark Sky Sanctuary\nIn January 2019, Stewart Island was accredited as a Dark Sky Sanctuary by the International Dark-Sky Association. This designation is given for sites in very remote locations to increase awareness of their dark sky characteristics and promote long-term conservation. The application for accreditation was made by Venture Southland, an agency responsible for the region's economic and community development initiatives and tourism promotion, with the aim of attracting more visitors, particularly in the winter period.\n\n\nTransport\n\n\nFerry services\nThe  ferry journey across Foveaux Strait between Bluff Harbour on the South Island and Oban in Stewart Island is about 39 km (21 nmi) long. The present high speed catamaran service typically takes one hour. As of 2024, the ferry service is operated by the tourism company RealNZ (formerly Real Journeys).\n\n\nHistory\nThe first scheduled service across Foveaux Strait began in 1877 for weekly mail delivery, but soon also carried passengers and general cargo. A larger vessel, the Bluff Harbour Board tug P.S. Awarua, took over the service in 1885. The Awarua arrived in Bluff on 4 January 1885, after a delivery voyage lasting more than 6 months since leaving dock in London. A trial excursion to Stewart Island on the Awarua took place on 10 March 1885, and a weekly service to Steward Island commenced.  A government subsidy was required to support the service, but it brought economic benefit by supporting the development of the fishing industry based on Stewart Island and increased the number of visitors. Many different vessels were used by the Bluff Harbour Board on the Foveaux Strait ferry service in the first half of the 20th century, including the Southland and Theresa Ward, MV. Tamatea, and the steamer Orewa.  Demands for a daily service across Foveaux were published in 1937. The twin screw steamer Wairua took over the Foveaux Strait ferry service in 1944. By 1959, the ferry service was operating with annual losses of £7,464. The steamer Wairua was 46 years old by that time, and a new replacement vessel was planned. In the interim, the government ship Matai replaced the Wairua.\nBy 1960, a new vessel to take over the Foveaux Strait service was under construction in Auckland. It was the largest ship to be constructed in New Zealand at that time, and was also named Wairua. The delivery voyage to Bluff was completed on 19 December 1961, and her first crossing of Foveaux Strait was on 20 December. The new Wairua was the first vessel in New Zealand to be fitted with anti-roll capabilities. The service to Stewart Island was twice a week during winter, and three times a week during summer. By 1985, the accumulated losses in operating the Wairua on the Foveaux Strait service over the previous 10 years totalled $6 million. The Minister of Transport, Richard Prebble, announced that the losses could not continue, and that the service would be withdrawn. Private operators would be invited to operate a service. The Wairua continued on the Stewart Island ferry service until September 1985, when she was sold for service in Fiji.\nPrivate operators provided a replacement ferry service to Stewart Island after the government service ended in 1985. A new ferry for the Stewart Island service was built in Invercargill for the company Stewart Island Marine, and launched in April 1999. The new vessel was a catamaran capable of taking 100 passengers, one third more than the vessel it replaced. In 2004, after operating the business for 14 years, Stewart Island Marine sold the ferry service to Stewart Island Experience — a joint venture between two private individuals and the tourism company Real Journeys. A third vessel seating 160 passengers was added to the service in December 2004. However, within two weeks of beginning service, the vessel was sold to Fullers Northland for service in the Bay of Islands, after Fullers suffered the loss of a vessel. Real Journeys bought out their partners to take complete control of the Stewart Island ferry service in May 2005. In 2015, responding to proposals for subsidised travel to Stewart Island for senior citizens, the chief executive of Real Journeys stated: \"Not only are Stewart Island ferries completely unsubsidised but the Foveaux Strait is an extremely expensive piece of water to operate on commercially\".\n\n\nAir services\nStewart Island Flights provides air services across Foveaux Strait between Invercargill Airport  and Ryan's Creek Aerodrome on Stewart Island. Their aircraft also land on the sand at Mason Bay, Doughboy Bay, and West Ruggedy Beach.\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1950, a licence was granted to Amphibian Airways to operate an air service between Invercargill and Stewart Island. In December 1950, finance was being sought for the purchase of a Grumman Widgeon amphibious aircraft. The inaugural flight to Half Moon Bay was made on 20 March 1951, with plans for a weekly service. In 1976, Stewart Island Air Services took over an amphibian air service to Stewart Island that had previously been operated by the Mount Cook Group. In 1980, Stewart Island Air Services rebranded as Southern Air. By 1980, a sealed airstrip had been built at Ryan's Creek above Oban, and services from Invercargill were provided using Nomad and Britten-Norman Islander aircraft.\nIn 1998 a Southern Air Cessna ditched into Foveaux Strait on a trip from Stewart Island to Invercargill after losing power to both engines, resulting in five deaths.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nSpark, 2degrees, and One NZ all offer 3G cellphone coverage. Spark also offers 4G 700 MHz coverage. Spark provides 4G Wireless Broadband, with One NZ providing 3G Rural Wireless Broadband. All these services are delivered via a radio link from Bluff.\nSince 1988, the electricity supply on Stewart Island has come from diesel generators; previously, residents used their own private generators. As a consequence, electric power is around three times more expensive than in the South Island, at NZ$0.59/kWh in 2016 and NZ$0.85/kWh in 2025. After photovoltaic and wind generation were tested on the island, the government's Provincial Growth Fund put $3.16 million towards building wind turbines on Stewart Island. The effort was defeated by local landowners who refused to grant access to the site through their property and general obstruction efforts by various parties. In June 2025, the government announced a $15m loan for a solar project on the island, with plans for a 2 MW solar farm and 4 MWh battery installed by the end of 2027.\n\n\nPublicity and promotions\nResidents of Stewart Island have held a number of mock promotional fundraising events regarding a declaration of independence for the island, and to have it renamed to its original name of \"Rakiura\". An effort to raise NZ$6,000 for a new swimming pool at the island's school involved selling 50-cent passports for the newly \"independent\" island. On 31 July 1970, a mock ceremony featured a declaration of independence, and the new republic's flag was unveiled. These efforts were not serious attempts for independence, and Stewart Island remains a part of the New Zealand state.\n\n\nSee also\nDark sky movement in New Zealand\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\"Stewart Island/Rakiura Conservation Management Strategy and Rakiura National Park Management Plan\" (PDF).

It encompasses two areas of coastal desert in the eastern Arabian Peninsula, the Wahiba Sands in eastern Oman, and the Huqf region to the southwest. The ecoregion has a total area of 1,769 km2.\nThe northern section encompasses the Wahiba Sands, a dune field that extends inland from the Arabian Sea coast. The southern section, known as the Huqf region, is bounded on the east by the Arabian Sea and on the west by the Huqf escarpment and Jiddat al-Harasis plateau. The Huqf region's landscape is more varied, with gravel deserts, salt flats or ‘sabkha’, rugged hills and outcrops, and coastal white sugar dunes near Al Khaluf.\n\n\nClimate\nThe region has a desert climate, with less than 50 mm of rainfall annually. Temperatures are warm throughout the year, reaching up to 40 °C in the warmer summer months and averaging 25 °C in the winter months. The region has a strong marine influence, with moisture-bearing winds from the Arabian Sea in winter and the southwest monsoon in summer that form fogs which provide moisture to plants from condensation.\n\n\nFlora\n\nThe vegetation consists mostly of sparse shrubs and ephemeral grasses, with areas of open woodland. Calligonum spp. shrubs and sedges grow on mobile dune tops, and the subshrub Heliotropium bacciferum subsp. tuberculosum on grows on stabilized sands. The subshrubs sea-lavender (Limonium spp.) and Zygophyllum qatarense grow on the seashore in the northern part of the ecoregion, while the shrub Halopeplis perfoliata and the grasses Urochondra setulosa and sand couch (Sporobolus virginicus) predominate along the southern coast.\nGhaf trees (Prosopis cineraria) form open woodlands, which provide habitat for many of the region's native birds and mammals.\n\n\nFauna\nNative mammals include the Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Arabian gazelle (Gazella arabica), sand cat (Felis margarita), Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii), and Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs). Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) and Blanford's fox (Vulpes cana) dwell along the Huqf escarpment.\nResident and migratory birds live in the woodlands and dune scrub, and the coastal dunes are important stopovers for migratory birds.\n\n\nDelineation\nThe East Arabian fog shrublands and sand desert was designated a distinct ecoregion by Dinerstein et al. in their 2017 revision of the Earth's terrestrial ecoregions. In the 2001 ecoregion scheme by Olson et al. the Wahiba Sands were part of the Arabian Desert ecoregion, while the Huqf region was  divided between the Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert and Red Sea Nubo–Sindian tropical desert and semi-desert ecoregions.\n\n\nConservation and threats\nThe Ash Sharqiyah Sand Reserve protects most of the Wahiba Sands. The Al Wusta Wildlife Reserve protects a portion of the Huqf region and Huqf escarpment, and of the upland South Arabian plains and plateau desert on the Jiddat al-Harasis plateau.\n\n\nReferences", "revid": 1324563637, "rev_timestamp": "2025-11-28T08:54:07Z", "source": "enwiki"}
{"eco_id": 498, "eco_name": "Rio Negro campinarana", "wiki_title": "Campinarana", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campinarana", "extract_text": "Campinarana (NT0158, Portuguese pronunciation: [kɐ̃ˌpinɐˈɾɐ̃nɐ]), also called Rio Negro Campinarana, is a neotropical ecoregion in the Amazon biome of the north west of Brazil, southern Venezuela, and the east of Colombia that contains vegetation adapted to extremely poor soil. It includes savanna, scrub and forest, and contains many endemic species of fauna and flora.\n\n\nLocation\nAreas of campinarana, which may cover several thousand square kilometres, are found in the transitional region from the Guyana Shield to the Amazon basin.\nLarge stretches of Campinarana are contained within the Japurá-Solimões-Negro moist forests, Negro-Branco moist forests, Guianan piedmont and lowland moist forests, Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests and Guianan savanna.\nThe campinarana ecoregion totals about 31,200 square miles (81,000 km2).\nCampinarana is mainly found in flat flooded areas in the Rio Negro and Rio Branco basins, which are tributaries of the Amazon, in northern Brazil along the borders of Colombia and Venezuela, and in the Ventuari–upper Orinoco basin in Venezuela's southernmost state of Amazonas.\nSmaller patches are found throughout the Amazon region. Areas of white-sand soils and their characteristic campinarana vegetation are found in the Serra do Cachimbo on the Pará–Mato Grosso boundary, the Parecis plateau in Rondônia, the Atlantic coast near the mouth of the Amazon, and in Maranhão. Similar vegetation is found in northern Peru, eastern Colombia and south western Venezuela.\n\n\nClimate\nTemperatures in the region average 24 °C (75 °F) and average rainfall is 2,500 to 3,000 millimetres (98 to 118 in).\n\n\nSoil characteristics\nTropical soils are generally infertile, and white sand soils are among the most infertile of such soils, primarily composed of quartz sand.\nThe white sands are found on arenaceous sediments on the low terra firme uplands, on natural levees in a flooded Várzea forest, on restinga sand dunes in a coastal lowland, on Cretaceous sandstone plateaus and on hill areas of granitic rocks.\nThe soil type determines the ecosystem more than temperature or rainfall.\nFactors affecting the vegetation are poor drainage, extremely sandy soil, intense leaching and impermeable layers below the surface.\nCampinarana is typically found on leached white sands around circular swampy depressions in lowland tropical moist forest.\nThe soil is low in nutrients, with highly acidic humus.\nA study at San Carlos de Río Negro, near the confluence of the Guainia and Casiquiare rivers in southern Venezuela, found the soils were similar to temperate podzols.\nThey had a thick humus layer, a highly leached A horizon, and a well developed Bh horizon at 1 metre (3 ft 3 in).\nTropical rainfall over millions of years had intensely leached the soils, which had become infertile due to lack of a source of fresh parent material.\nThey may be short of phosphorus and/or calcium.\nThe water that drains the Campinarana is tea colored, often called blackwater.\nThe low exchange capacity of the podzols lets decomposing organic matter dissolve in soil water as humic acids, from where it is carried into the nearby streams.\n\n\nEcology\n\n\nFlora\nCampinarana has very varied vegetation formations from fields to forests with thin trees.\nThe sclerophyllous vegetation is adapted to the sandy soil, with high endemism and low diversity.\nCampinarana vegetation includes savanna, scrub and forests.\nThe Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics defines four subtypes, or formations, of vegetation:\n\nThe forests are found higher up.\nThey have trees up to 30 metres (98 ft) from families that differ from those in the humid rain forest that surrounds the Campinarana.\nThe scrub has bare sand, herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees less than 7 metres (23 ft) high.\nThe palm Barcella odora is endemic.\nIt is found on the sides of the depressions.\nThe savannah is mainly composed of grasses and lichens, found in the wet plains beside lakes and rivers.\n\n\nFauna\nFauna are less diverse in the campinarana than in the surrounding ecoregions.\n153 species of mammals have been reported.\nMammals with restricted distribution include white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), golden-backed uakari (Cacajao melanocephalus), red-faced spider monkey (Ateles paniscus), mottle-faced tamarin (Saguinus inustus), Isabelle's ghost bat (Diclidurus isabella), Marinkelle's sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina marinkellei), least big-eared bat (Neonycteris pusilla), Ega long-tongued bat (Scleronycteris ega), Brock's yellow-eared bat (Vampyriscus brocki), yellow-throated squirrel (Sciurus gilvigularis), northern grass mouse (Necromys urichi), black-tailed hairy dwarf porcupine (Coendou melanurus) and Tome's spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus).\nOther mammals include collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), jaguar (Panthera onca) and red brocket (Mazama americana).\nEndangered mammals include white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), Fernandez's sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina fernandezi), Marinkelle's sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina marinkellei) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).\n368 species of birds have been recorded, fewer than in the surrounding forest.\nEndemic species include Rio Branco antbird (Cercomacra carbonaria), spot-backed antwren (Herpsilochmus dorsimaculatus), chestnut-crested antbird (Rhegmatorhina cristata) and Orinoco piculet (Picumnus pumilus).\nSpecies with restricted distribution include russet-backed oropendola (Psarocolius angustifrons), white-bellied dacnis (Dacnis albiventris), dotted tanager (Tangara varia), Serra do Mar tyrant-manakin (Neopelma chrysolophum), yellow-crested manakin (Heterocercus flavivertex) and crestless curassow (Mitu tomentosum).\nEndangered birds include Rio Branco antbird (Cercomacra carbonaria) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis).\n\n\nStatus\nThe World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \"Relatively Stable/Intact\".\nNone of the ecoregion is protected, but most of it is relatively intact due to its low productivity.\nSome areas have suffered from cattle grazing, with burning to maintain pasturage.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Campinarana at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1315498136, "rev_timestamp":

{"eco_id": 53, "eco_name": "Sahelian Acacia savanna", "wiki_title": "Sahel", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "extract_text": "The Sahel region (; from Arabic  ساحل (sāḥil [ˈsaːħil]) 'coast, shore'), or Sahelian acacia savanna, is a biogeographical region in Africa. It is the transition zone between the more humid Sudanian savannas to its south and the drier Sahara to the north. The Sahel has a hot semi-arid climate and stretches across the southernmost latitudes of North Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. Although geographically located in the tropics, the Sahel does not have a tropical climate.\nEspecially in the western Sahel, there are frequent shortages of food and water due to its very high government corruption and the semi-arid climate. Nonetheless the region has sustained very high human birthrates, resulting in a rapid increase in population. In recent times, various coups, insurgencies, terrorism and foreign interventions have taken place in many Sahel countries, especially across former Françafrique. \nIn addition to its ecological and climatic significance, the Sahel is also considered a geopolitical space, shaped by internal instability and external strategic competition.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe Sahel spans 5,900 km (3,670 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Red Sea in the east, in a belt several hundred to a thousand kilometers (c. 600 miles) wide. It covers an area of 3,053,200 square kilometers (1,178,850 sq mi).\nRepresenting a climatic and ecological transition zone with hot semi-desert and steppe conditions, the Sahel region borders the more humid Sudanian savannas to its south and the dry Sahara desert to the north. This ecoregion is also called the Sahelian Acacia savanna in honour of its most prominent and very drought tolerant genus of tree.\nThe topography of the Sahel is mainly flat; most of the region lies between 200 and 400 meters (660 and 1,310 ft) in elevation. Several isolated plateaus and mountain ranges rise from the Sahel (e.g. Marrah Mountains, Aïr Mountains, Ennedi Plateau), but are designated as separate ecoregions because their flora and fauna are distinct from the surrounding lowlands (e.g. East Saharan woodlands). Annual rainfall varies from around 100–200 mm (4–8 in) in the north of the Sahel to around 700–1,000 mm (28–39 in) in the south.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe Sahel is mostly covered in grassland and savanna, with areas of woodland and shrubland. Grass cover is fairly continuous across the region, dominated by annual grass species such as Cenchrus biflorus, Schoenefeldia gracilis and Aristida stipoides. Species of acacia are the dominant trees, with Acacia tortilis the most common, along with Senegalia senegal and Senegalia laeta. Other tree species include Adansonia digitata, Commiphora africana, Balanites aegyptiaca, Faidherbia albida, Borassus aethiopum, Vitellaria paradoxa, Olea europaea, Arbutus unedo, Phoenix canariensis, Hyphaene compressa, Cupressus sempervirens, Quercus coccifera, Quercus suber, Pinus nigra, Populus nigra, Ceratonia siliqua, Salix alba, Afzelia africana, Kigelia africana, Sclerocarya birrea, and Boscia senegalensis. In the northern part of the Sahel, areas of desert shrub, including Panicum turgidum and Aristida sieberiana, alternate with areas of grassland and savanna. During the long dry season, many trees lose their leaves and the predominantly annual grasses die.\nThe Sahel was formerly home to large populations of grazing mammals, including the scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), dama gazelle (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons), the giant prehistoric buffalo (Pelorovis), and Bubal hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus buselaphus), along with large predators, such as the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), the Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), the Northeast African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), and the lion (Panthera leo). The larger species have been greatly reduced in number by over-hunting and competition with livestock, and several species are vulnerable (Dorcas gazelle, cheetah, lion and red-fronted gazelle), endangered (Dama gazelle and African wild dog), or extinct (the Scimitar-horned oryx is probably extinct in the wild, and both Pelorovis and the Bubal hartebeest are now extinct).\nThe seasonal wetlands of the Sahel are important for migratory birds moving within Africa and on the African-Eurasian flyways.\n\n\nClimate\n\nThe Sahel has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh). The climate is typically hot, sunny, dry and somewhat windy all year long. The Sahel's climate is similar to, but less extreme than, the climate of the Sahara desert located just to the north.\nThe Sahel mainly receives a low to very low amount of precipitation annually. The steppe has a very long, prevailing dry season and a short rainy season. The precipitation is also extremely irregular, and varies considerably from season to season. Most of the rain usually falls during four to six months in the middle of the year, while the other months may remain absolutely dry. The interior of the Sahel region generally receives between 200 mm and 700 mm of rain yearly. A system of subdivisions often adopted for the Sahelian climate based on annual rainfall is as follows: the Saharan-Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 100 and 200 mm (such as Khartoum, Sudan), the strict Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 200 and 700 mm (such as Niamey, Niger) and the Sahelian-Sudanese climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 700 and 900 mm (such as Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso). The relative humidity in the steppe is low to very low, often between 10% and 25% during the dry season and between 25% and 75% during the rainy season. The least humid places have a relative humidity under 35%. Annual rain levels were measured to fall between 20-40% in a span of two decades from 1931-1960 and 1968-1990; the levels recovered slightly in the mid-1990s in some areas, especially in central and eastern areas as far as Senegal.\nThe Sahel is characterized by constant, intense heat, with an unvarying temperature. The Sahel rarely experiences cold temperatures. During the hottest period, the average high temperatures are generally between 36 and 42 °C (97 and 108 °F) (and even more in the hottest regions), often for more than three months, while the average low temperatures are around 25 to 31 °C (77 to 88 °F). During the \"coldest period\", the average high temperatures are between 27 and 33 °C (81 and 91 °F) and the average low temperatures are between 15 and 21 °C (59 and 70 °F). Everywhere in the Sahel, the average mean temperature is over 18 °C (64 °F).\nThe Sahel has a high to very high sunshine duration year-round, between 2,400 hours (about 55% of the daylight hours) and 3,600 hours (more than 80% of the daylight hours). The sunshine duration in the Sahel approaches desert levels, and is comparable to that in the Arabian Desert, for example, even though the Sahel is only a steppe and not a desert. The cloud cover is low to very low. For example, Niamey, Niger has 3,082 hours of bright sunshine; Gao, Mali has near 3,385 hours of sunshine; Timbuktu, Mali has 3,409 sunny hours, and N'Djamena, Chad has 3,205 hours of sunlight.\n\n\nRecent droughts\n\nFor hundreds of years, the Sahel region has experienced frequent droughts and megadroughts. One megadrought lasted from 1450 to 1700, 250 years. There was a major drought in the Sahel in 1914 caused by annual rains far below average, leading to large-scale famine. From 1951 to 2004, the Sahel experienced some of the most consistent and severe droughts in Africa. The 1960s saw a large increase in rainfall in the region, making the northern drier region more accessible. There was a push, supported by governments, for people to move northwards. When the long drought period from 1968 through 1974 began, grazing quickly became unsustainable and large-scale denuding of the terrain followed. Like the drought in 1914, this led to a large-scale famine, but this time somewhat tempered by international visibility and an outpouring of aid. This catastrophe led to the founding of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.\n\n\n2010 drought\n \nBetween June and August 2010, famine struck the Sahel. Niger's crops failed to mature in the heat, 350,000 faced starvation, and 1,200,000 were at risk of famine. In Chad the temperature reached 47.6 °C (117.7 °F) on 22 June in Faya-Largeau, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Niger tied its highest temperature record set in 1998, also on 22 June, at 47.1 °C in Bilma. That record was broken the next day, when Bilma hit 48.2 °C (118.8 °F). The hottest temperature recorded in Sudan was reached on 25 June, at 49.6 °C (121.3 °F) in Dongola, breaking a record set in 1987. Niger reported on 14 July that diarrhoea, starvation, gastroenteritis, malnutrition and respiratory diseases had sickened or killed many children. The new military junta appealed for international food aid and took serious steps to call on overseas help. On 26 July, the heat reached near-record levels over Chad and Niger, and in northern Niger about 20 people reportedly died of dehydration by 27 July.\n\n\nDesertification and soil loss\n\nThe Sahel region faces environmental issues that are contributing to global warming. If the change in climate in the Sahel region \"is not slowed-down and desertification possibly reversed through sustainable practices and any form of reforestation, it is only a matter of time before countries like Niger lose their entire landmass to desert due to unchecked unsustainable human practices.\" Over-farming, over-grazing, over-population of marginal lands, and natural soil erosion have caused serious desertification of the region. This has affected shelter construction, making it necessary to change the used materials. The Woodless Construction project was introduced in Sahel in 1980 by the Development Workshop, achieving since then a high social impact in the region. A major initiative to combat desertification in the Sahel region via reforestation and other interventions is the Great Green Wall.\nMajor dust storms are a frequent occurrence as well. During November 2004, a number of major dust storms hit Chad, originating in the Bodélé Depression. This is a common area for dust storms, occurring on average on 100 days every year.\n\nOn 23 March 2010, a major sandstorm hit Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and inland Sierra Leone. Another struck in southern Algeria, inland Mauritania, Mali and northern Ivory Coast at the same time.\nFollowing the drought period of the 1970s and 1980, however, the Sahel began to experience increased rainfall. This may be due to global warming, which can cause changes that may result in changes in large-scale weather patterns, such as increased stronger monsoons, in turn caused by a warmer Atlantic Ocean. Warming of the Mediterranean Sea may also be a factor.\n\n\nProtected areas\nProtected areas in the Sahel include Ferlo Nord Wildlife Reserve in Senegal, Sylvo-Pastoral and Partial Faunal Reserve of the Sahel in Burkina Faso, Ansonga-Ménake Faunal Reserve in Mali, Tadres Reserve in Niger, and Waza National Park in Cameroon.\n\n\nCulture\n\nTraditionally, most of the people in the Sahel have been semi-nomads, farming and raising livestock in a system of transhumance. The difference between the dry north with higher levels of soil nutrients and the wetter south with more vegetation is exploited by having the herds graze on high-quality feed in the north during the wet season, and trek several hundred kilometers to the south to graze on more abundant, but less nutritious, feed during the dry period.\nIn Western Sahel, polygamy and child marriage are common. Female genital mutilation is also practiced across the Sahel.\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\nFrench\nFrench is spoken widely in the Sahel, as many of its nations are former French colonies, with two adopting French as an official language and many more using it colloquially. The Sahel includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan and Eritrea, where French is employed to varying degrees.\n\n\nColonial History\nThe French language in the Sahel, as in much of Africa, is a remnant of colonial history and a foreign import to a region characterized by linguistic diversity. After establishing French culture in northern Senegal in the mid-19th century, colonial governors like General Louis Faidherbe pushed deeper into the Sahel's interior, facing opposition from regional leaders. Despite resistance, territory was accrued and placed under the control of lieutenant governors who extracted resources and labor from local populations. The greater Sahel was subsequently organized into the massive territory of French West Africa in 1895, noted for its linguistic diversity.\n\n\nStatus of the French Language\nFrench has been the official language of most Sahel countries at various points in their history, but the trend of removing its official status has gained momentum since the end of French military intervention in the region in 2022. Since then, the governments of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have stripped French from being an official language, punctuating a broader theme of the Sahel's self-isolation from Paris.\nAlthough there is evidence of its use in nearly every Sahel country, research suggests that French is more often a Lingua franca of business among the elite and educated classes than a conduit of practical everyday dialogue.\nWest African and Sahel loanwords have entered the lexicon of modern standard French, usually in the context of vernacular or slang elocution. This trend is mostly understood by the wave of African migrants to France since the end of the colonial era, but has intensified since the explosion of the youth population of Africa. Sahel loanwords are challenging the historic rigidity of the French language and its corresponding cultural norms.\n\n\nLinguistic Specificities\nCode-switching and linguistic blending is extremely common among French speakers in the Sahel, like other regions known for their linguistic diversity. Loanwords and phonetic irregularities derived from local languages have permeated Sahel French:\n\nOvert influence of English and even Chinese words in Burkinabè French, such as enjoy \"take pleasure/enjoy\" and chao/mao \"old.\"\nLigidi is a Mooré loanword meaning \"money.\"\nC' nekh comes from the French expression c'est bon but replaces bon with the Wolof word nekh, meaning \"good\" or \"pleasant.\"\nThe phoneme /y/ is pronounced more closely to /i/ by most French locutors in the Western Sahel.\nThe apical trill pronunciation of /r/, once common in metropolitan France, continues in West Africa despite the more common use of the uvular trill pronunciation by standard French speakers.\nLess phonetic variation exists between the vowels /ø/, /ə/, and /e/ among French speakers in Burkina Faso and Niger; /e/ characterizes the majority of these pronunciations.\n\n\nEtymology\nThe term \"Sahel\" is borrowed from the Arabic name for the region, الساحل al-sāḥil. Sāḥil literally means \"coast, shore\", which has been explained as a figurative reference to the southern edge of the vast Sahara. However, such use is unattested in Classical Arabic, and it has been suggested that the word may originally have been derived from the Arabic word سهل sahl \"plain\" instead.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nEarly agriculture\nAround 4000 BC, the climate of the Sahara and the Sahel started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and caused migrations of farming communities to the more humid climate of West Africa.\n\n\nSahelian kingdoms\n\nThe Sahelian kingdoms were a series of monarchies centered in the Sahel between the 9th and 18th centuries. The wealth of the states, like the legendary Mali Empire at the time of Mansa Musa, came from controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes across the desert, especially with the Maghreb. Their power came from having large pack animals like camels and horses that were fast enough to keep a large empire under central control and were also useful in battle. All of these empires were quite decentralized with member cities having a great deal of autonomy.\nThe larger Sahelian kingdoms emerged from 750 AD and erected several large cities in the Niger valley region, including Timbuktu, Gao and Djenné.\nDue to the wooded areas to their south, the Sahelian states were hindered from expanding into the north Akan state of the Bonoman and Yoruba peoples, as mounted warriors were all but useless in the forests. In addition, the horses and camels were susceptible to the humidity and diseases of the tropics.\n\n\nColonial period\nThe Western Sahel fell to France in the late 19th century as part of French West Africa. Chad was added in 1900 as part of French Equatorial Africa. The French territories in the Sahel were decolonised in 1960.\nThe Sahel's easternmost region did not fall to the European powers but to the Khedivate of Egypt when it was conquered by Muhammad Ali in the 1820s. By 1899 it came under British rule until granted independence at Egypt's behest in 1956.\n\n\nIndependence\n\n\nInstability and violence\n\n\nTerrorism\n\nAccording to The Economist, in recent years the Sahel has become the epicenter of terrorist violence, contributing to 35% of all global deaths from terrorism by 2021, with Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, identified as the world's fastest-growing terrorist organization. In 2023, fatalities from conflict in the central Sahel rose by 38%, according to data from the research organization Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.\nIn the wake of the Libyan Crisis beginning in 2011, terrorist organizations operating in the Sahel, including Boko Haram, Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), have greatly exacerbated the violence, extremism and instability of the region. In March 2020, the United States sent a special envoy for the Sahel region to combat the rising violence from terrorist groups. The Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need has highlighted the fact that the Sahel has become one of the most dangerous regions in the world for Christians.\nAs of 2024, a wave of new military juntas in Africa, favoring Russian mercenaries over Western forces and UN peacekeepers, has intensified violence. This led Mauritania and Chad to disband the G5 Sahel, an anti-terrorism alliance, after the military regimes in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali withdrew.\nAccording to the BBC, the Sahel region has become the global epicenter of terrorism, accounting for over half of all terrorism-related deaths, according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI). In 2023, the region recorded 3,885 fatalities out of a global total of 7,555, marking a nearly tenfold increase since 2019. The surge in extremist violence is attributed to the expansion of groups like the Islamic State's affiliate in the Sahel and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), who compete for land and influence while imposing strict Sharia-based governance. Political instability, weak governance, and the rise of military juntas following coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Niger have further fueled the insurgency. These groups sustain their operations through ransom kidnappings, illicit gold mining, and drug trafficking, with the Sahel now a major route for cocaine smuggling from South America to Europe. Meanwhile, governments in the region have shifted their alliances from Western nations to Russia and China, relying on paramilitary groups like the Africa Corps (formerly Wagner) for security assistance, though with limited success. The violence is increasingly spilling into neighboring countries such as Togo and Benin, raising concerns about the broader destabilization of West Africa.\n\n\nHuman rights issues and political instability\nOn 9 July 2020, the United States raised concerns over growing number of allegations of human rights violations and abuses by state security forces in Sahel. The US response came after Human Rights Watch released documents regarding the same on 1 July. Reports in March 2022 show militants are expanding and spreading out south of the Sahel.\nThe area has also seen a high prevalence of coups d'état, with military juntas currently ruling in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Sudan.\n\n\nOther challenges\n\nThe violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by climate change, land degradation, and rapid population growth. Droughts and food shortages have been also linked to the Mali War.\nThe Sahel is experiencing more severe weather due to climate change, exemplified by the extreme heatwave of March–April 2024 in Burkina Faso and Mali. This event was intensified by a 1.2 °C global temperature increase from human activities. Sahel is also considered as a geopolitical space as well. \n\n\nSee also\n2012 Sahel drought\nCommunity of Sahel–Saharan States\nPan Sahel Initiative\nRainwater harvesting in the Sahel\nSudan (region)\nSahara Conservation Fund\nTipping points in the climate system#Sahel greening\nTrans-Sahelian Highway\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\nAzam (ed.), Conflict and Growth in Africa: The Sahel, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (1999), ISBN 92-64-17101-0.\nLagha CHEGROUCHE, \"L'arc géopolitique de l'énergie : le croissant énergétique\", in Le Soir d'Algérie, 19/12/2010 (in French)\nKhatim Kherraz; Nabil Ben Khatra (2019).

The ecoregion is part of the larger California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, and belongs to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.\n\n\nGeography\nThe ecoregion spreads from low foothills up to the highest peaks of the following ranges: San Bernardino Mountains, San Jacinto Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, Santa Susana Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains, Sierra Pelona, Topatopa Mountains, Tehachapi Mountains, San Rafael Mountains, Santa Ynez Mountains, and the long Santa Lucia Mountains.\nThe wide elevation range and characteristic climate produce a variety of natural communities, from chaparral to mixed evergreen forest to alpine tundra.\n\n\nClimate\nThe region's Mediterranean climate is hot and dry in the summer and cool and wet in the winter. Mid-summer monsoonal thunderstorms often form over the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges of Southern California, introducing additional rain to the region.\n\n\nEcology\n\n\nFlora\nShrublands of Chamise, Manzanita species, and scrub oak tend to dominate the lower elevations of California montane chaparral and woodlands. This ecoregion contains several oak species, including coast live oak, canyon live oak (golden-cup oak), interior live oak, tan oak, and Engelmann oak. It has eight endemic conifer species.\nA mosaic of different manzanita species and closed-cone pine forest appears at higher elevations. Bigcone Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, is a notable resident of some of these communities. The Mediterranean California Lower Montane Black Oak-Conifer Forest plant community occurs here.\nMixed evergreen forest occurs from 4,500 to 9,500 feet (1,400 to 2,900 m) and includes incense-cedar, foothill pine, sugar pine, white fir, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, and western juniper. Higher elevations to 11,500 feet (3,500 m) support subalpine forests of limber pine, lodgepole pine, and Jeffrey pine.\nHesperoyucca whipplei, colloquially known as Chaparral Yucca, is commonplace throughout the lower elevations of the climate zone.\n\n\nFauna\nThe region contains many species of small vertebrate, including the western fence lizard, white-eared pocket mouse, several species of kangaroo rat, and the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog. The area includes some larger predators such as the black bear, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, ring-tailed cats, and the critically endangered California condor.\nThe monarch butterfly winters within the coastal woodlands this ecoregion.\n\n\nConservation status\nApproximately 30 percent of California montane chaparral and woodlands remains intact. About 70 percent has been lost due to degradation activities of humans. Montane chaparral is threatened chiefly by development, grazing, logging, conversion to vineyards, and too-frequent wildfire.\nThis is an ongoing threat notably in Southern California, but also in its northernmost reaches in Monterey County, where population pressure is most intense. Major urban centers located within this ecoregion include Monterey, Santa Barbara, Tehachapi, and the foothill portions of various cities fronting the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains.\nState and federal fish and wildlife agencies, and environmental associations are attempting to conserve the remaining intact ecoregion. The U.S. Forest Service efforts include timber harvest conservation measures in areas with endangered tree species and high endemic and relict species plant communities. Much of the range is within the Los Padres National Forest, Angeles National Forest, and San Bernardino National Forest. Mixed conifer and closed-cone pine forests have been heavily impacted by air pollution. Air quality has improved in southern montane areas around the Los Angeles Basin since implementation of smog reduction policies and practices in the latter 20th century.\n\n\nSee also\nCalifornia chaparral and woodlands ecoregion\nCalifornia coastal sage and chaparral — sub-ecoregion\nCalifornia interior chaparral and woodlands — sub-ecoregion\nCalifornia oak woodland — plant community\nMaritime coast range ponderosa pine forest — plant community\nMediterranean California Lower Montane Black Oak-Conifer Forest — plant community\nList of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to California montane chaparral and woodlands at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1328186134, "rev_timestamp": "2025-12-18T10:47:24Z", "source": "enwiki"}

It was discovered by Captain James Clark Ross in January 1841 and named after Queen Victoria. The rocky promontory of Minna Bluff is often regarded as the southernmost point of Victoria Land, and separates the Scott Coast to the north from the Hillary Coast of the Ross Dependency to the south. \n\n\nHistory\nEarly explorers of Victoria Land include James Clark Ross and Douglas Mawson.\nIn 1979, scientists discovered a group of 309 meteorites in Antarctica, some of which were found near the Allan Hills in Victoria Land. The meteorites appeared to have undergone little change since they were formed at what scientists believe was the birth of the Solar System.\nIn 1981, lichens found at Victoria Land attracted the attention of NASA because lichens may give clues about where to look for the existence of extraterrestrial life. Dr. George Denton, a glaciologist at the University of New Hampshire, looked for microorganisms on Mount Lister, one of the highest in Antarctica; it has the same kind of sandstone in which lichens grow.\nIn 2017, conservationists at Cape Adare, Victoria Land, unearthed an ice-covered fruitcake that they believe once belonged to the British explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Scott's Northern Party expedition was in 1911, making the age of the fruitcake 106 years old. A program manager said it was in \"excellent condition.\"\n\n\nGeography\nThe region includes ranges of the Transantarctic Mountains and the McMurdo Dry Valleys (the highest point being Mount Abbott in the Northern Foothills), and the flatlands known as the Labyrinth. The 2,700-metre (9,000 ft) Mount Melbourne is an active volcano in Victoria Land.\n\n\nReferences", "revid": 1271675676, "rev_timestamp": "2025-01-25T04:25:36Z", "source": "enwiki"}
{"eco_id": 616, "eco_name": "Southern Atlantic Brazilian mangroves", "wiki_title": "Bahia mangroves", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia_mangroves", "extract_text": "The Bahia mangroves is a tropical ecoregion of the mangroves biome, and the South American Atlantic Forest biome, located in Northeastern Brazil. Its conservation status is considered to be critical/endangered due to global climate change and other factors.\n\n\nGeography\nThe Bahia mangrove habitats occupy minor bays, estuaries, and river inlets along the coast from Recôncavo on Todos os Santos Bay in Bahia State; north to the Doce River in Espírito Santo State.\nThe total ecoregion comprises  2,100 square kilometers (800 square miles) of shallow coastal waters and land.\n\n\nFlora\n\nMangrove tree species include typical Atlantic Ocean tropical mangrove species, the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) of the Rhizophoraceae, the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) of the Acanthaceae, and the white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) of the Combretaceae family.\n\n\nFauna\n\nBenthic macrofauna are an important basis underlying the ecological functioning of coastal food webs in the Bahia mangroves ecoregion. Mangroves provide habitat for juvenile fishes and crustacea.\nThe Mangrave crab (Ucides cordatus)  is particularly important as an economic and subsistence resource and as a bioindicator of environmental pollution.\nThe ecoregion is home to five species of sea turtle: the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), green turtle (Chelonia mydas), leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and olive turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea).  All of these are endangered.\nBoth local and migratory birds utilize the Bahia mangroves. The mangroves provide homes to the black-hooded antwren (Myrmotherula urosticta), Bahia tapaculo (Scytalopus psychopompus) and Dubois' seed-eater (Sporophila falcirostris). Bahia mangroves provide nesting sites for the great egret (Casmerodius albus), little blue heron (Florida caerulea), and snowy egret (Egretta thula). The semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) migrate to the area where they are found between September and April.\n\n\nConservation\nMangrove ecosystems can naturally absorb amounts of carbon dioxide comparable to the Amazon rainforest, making them a valuable resource in countering global climate change.\nGlobal climate change is leading to rising sea levels and to rising water temperatures, which in turn threaten crabs, oysters and other creatures in the Bahia mangroves' food chain. Water levels are observed to have risen 20-30 centimeters in the past 100 years, along the coast of Bahia state.  While many plants in the mangrove ecosystem are fairly resilient, other marine life is less so. Crabs, for example, depend on a narrow range of water temperature and acidity.\nTraditional hand-catching methods for Mangrave crabs that have developed in local communities in Brazil attempt to maintain the crab population at a subsistence level. The population is under threat in part due to predatory techniques of tangle-netting that are being introduced by members of marginalized groups entering the Bahia mangroves and exploiting them for survival.\nClearing of the mangrove forests for development is also a significant conservation threat. Approximately 4% of mangroves worldwide were estimated to be lost between 1980 and 2005. Brazilian mangroves are threatened by coastal urban sprawl, and by managed aquiculture enterprises, such as shrimp farms in Salinas da Margarida.\n\nIn 2019 the worst oil spill in Brazilian history polluted more than 2,400 km (1,500 mi) of Brazilian coastline, including parts of Abrolhos Marine National Park and areas of Bahia mangroves and coral reefs. Such areas are considered \"particularly vulnerable to damage\" and extremely difficult to clean.\nAll mangroves in Brazil are legally designated as \"permanent protection zones\" or ‘Areas of Permanent Protection’(APPs) in 2002.  An attempt was made to rescind this protection  in September 2020 by Environment Minister Ricardo Salles, the  National Environmental Council, and the Brazilian government of Jair Bolsonaro. The attempt was blocked by a Brazilian Federal court judge who ruled that repeal of the protections would violate \"the constitutional right to an ecologically balanced environment\".\n\n\nSee also\nList of plants of Atlantic Forest vegetation of Brazil — flora of its diverse ecoregions.\nEcoregions in the Atlantic Forest biome\nMangrove ecoregions\nList of ecoregions in Brazil\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Southern Atlantic Brazilian Mangroves Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons\n\"Bahia mangroves\".

It is a southern variation of Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic. The ecoregion supports habitats of forest, savanna and swamps. The southern portion of the ecoregion is not as well studied due to the 1977-1992 civil war in Mozambique.\n\n\nGeography\nThe ecoregion extends along the coast of Tanzania and Mozambique, from Tanzania's Lukuledi River south almost the whole way to the mouth of the Limpopo River.\nIt is mostly coastal, generally within 50 km of the Indian Ocean. It encompasses coastal lowlands, rolling hills, and isolated plateaus and inselbergs, including the Rondo and Makonde plateaus in southern Tanzania, the Mueda Plateau in northern Mozambique.\nIt includes some isolated mountainous enclaves further inland, including Mount Chiperone, Mount Mabu, Mount Morrumbala, Mount Namuli, and Mount Tumbine in northern Mozambique, and the southeastern slopes of the Eastern Highlands, including Moribane forest. The mountains intercept humid southwesterly winds from the Indian Ocean, which form clouds and rain and create a cooler, wetter climate than the surrounding lowlands. These mountains are home to lowland evergreen forests with a similar flora to the coastal lowland forests, and higher-elevation montane forests, woodlands, grasslands, and heathlands which are home to many Afromontane species. The WWF scheme follows Frank White's 1983 \"Vegetation Map of Africa\" by including these inland mountains in the coastal forest mosaic ecoregion. Other researchers, including Jonathan Timberlake of Kew Gardens, maintain that the flora and fauna of Northern Mozambique's interior inselbergs, especially at higher elevations, have greater affinity with the Afromontane Eastern Arc forests. Bayliss et al. concluded that the northern Mozambican inselbergs, together with the Mulanje Massif of southern Malawi, constitute a separate South East Africa Montane Archipelago ecoregion.\nThe ecoregion is bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean. To the north, it abuts the Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic. It transitions to drier open woodlands to the west – the Eastern miombo woodlands at the northern end, the Zambezian and mopane woodlands in the central portion, and the Southern miombo woodlands at the southern end. To the south, it borders the Maputaland coastal forest mosaic. It also includes some small offshore islands in Mozambique, including the Quirimbas Islands and Bazarruto Archipelago.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is tropical in the northern portion, becoming sub-tropical at the southern end. In the area around Lindi in Tanzania there is one long dry season and one wet season. Rainfall is 800–1000 mm per year, and is higher on some of the plateaus and mountains. The climate is similar in the Mozambican portion, although rainfall is lower (800 mm) in northern Mozambique, which is in the rain shadow of Madagascar. Mean maximum temperatures are 30-27 °C in the north and 24 °C in the south, and mean minimum temperature is 18-15 °C throughout the ecoregion.\n\n\nFlora\nThe vegetation of the ecoregion is a mosaic of tropical moist forest, tropical dry forest, thicket, miombo woodland, grassland, and wetland.\nDry forests and thickets are found in the northern portion of the ecoregion. This region, comprising southeastern Tanzania and northeastern Mozambique, is in the rain shadow of Madagascar, and rainfall is lower (less than 1000 mm annually) than in the coastal forests to the north and south. The dry forests have a closed canopy, with a large proportion of deciduous species that lose their leaves in the long and hot dry season. Dense thickets form where dry forests have been disturbed by human activity. Dry forests are typically found on soils derived from iron-rich sandstone and conglomerates of the Mikindani Formation. Typical dry forest tree species in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado Province include Manilkara sansibarensis, Warneckea sansibarica, Baphia macrocalyx, and Pteleopsis myrtifolia. 738 plant species were identified from the dry forests of Cabo Delgado. The plant families with the most species include Rubiaceae with 84 species, Leguminaceae subfamilies Papilionoideae (43 species), Mimosoideae (29 species), and Caesalpinioideae (24 species), and Euphorbiaceae (41 species), Apocynaceae (28 species), and Lamiaceae (28 species). Human activity has fragmented the dry forests into small patches, and it is estimated that 80% have been lost in the last 100 to 150 years.\nThe Rondo, Chitoa, and Makonde plateaus and adjacent coastal lowlands of southeastern Tanzania, at the northern end of the ecoregion, are home to at least 76 endemic species of plants, along with several endemic species and subspecies of animals. The region is known as the Lindi sub-centre of endemism.\nThere are fewer known endemics in the Mozambican portion of the ecoregion. Cola clavata is an endangered tree endemic to the coastal forests of Sofala and Zambezia provinces in central Mozambique.\n\n\nFauna\nLarge mammals include the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), roan antelope (H. equinus), and Lichtenstein's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus lichtensteinii), which also inhabit the adjacent Eastern miombo woodlands. Vincent's bush squirrel (Paraxerus vincenti) is endemic to Mount Namuli in Mozambique.\nThe northernmost portion of the ecoregion around Lindi in Southeastern Tanzania, including coastal forests and the Rondo, Chitoa, and Makonde plateaus, is home to several endemic and limited range species. These include the southern population of the primate Rondo dwarf galago (Paragalago rondoensis), the endemic birds Reichenow's batis (Batis reichenowi) and an endemic subspecies of green barbet (Stactolaema olivacea hylophona), the reptiles Melanoceps rondoensis, Scolecoseps litapoensis, Typhlops rondoensis, and Chirindia rondoensis, and two endemic butterfly species.

It is classed as an Afrotropical fog desert\n\n\nLocation and description\nThis ecosystem exists on a strip along the western and eastern coasts of Arabia. It follows the coast of Oman southward from Masirah Island and reaches inland to 120 kilometres (75 mi) in the Jiddat al Harasisi plateau and the Dhofar Mountains. From here it continues as a very narrow strip (only 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) wide) along the coast of Yemen and up the 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide the Tihamah plain along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. In Oman and Yemen moisture is provided by thick fogs coming off the ocean during the summer khareef monsoon, while the hot Tihamah plain is moisturised by some rainfall and the generally high humidity of the Red Sea.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nAlthough it rarely rains, the fog provides moisture sufficient to nurture a great deal of grassland, shrubs and thick woodland. There are over 60 local species of plants. This coastal strip is of particular importance because further inland where the fog does not have an influence, most of the Arabian Peninsula is desert. \nVegetation varies progressively away from the coast which features dense woodland of Terminalia dhofarica, Senegalia senegal and various thorny Commiphora trees and shrubs. The richest flora can be found in the Dhofar Mountains which have 900 plants including 60 endemic species. One of these plants, Boswellia sacra (frankincense), was a source of great wealth for Dhofar in antiquity. In Yemen, the side of Jabal Urays facing the sea is covered with Euphorbia balsamifera shrubs.\nThe many mammals found here include the Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx) which was reintroduced to the wild after disappearing, Arabian Gazelle and Nubian Ibex, a goat antelope. Predators found on the coast include Caracal,  Arabian Wolf, Striped Hyena and the critically endangered Arabian Leopard (Panthera pardus nimr), which survives on Jebel Samhan in the Dhofar mountains.\n\n\nThreats and preservation\nThe main threat to this ecosystem is overgrazing by increasing numbers of cattle and other livestock as well as off-road driving and human encroachment. Urban areas in this ecoregion include: in Oman the port of Duqm and the Dhofar capital of Salalah; in Yemen, the Hadhramaut port capital Mukalla, the former capital and ancient port of Aden, the Red Sea coffee ports of Al Hudaydah (the largest town on this coast of Yemen) and Mocha, and the World Heritage Site of Zabid; and the city of Jizan, the fruit basket of Saudi Arabia. \nProtected areas in Oman include the controversial Arabian Oryx Sanctuary where the reintroduction took place, and Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve established for the protection of the leopards. There are several Important Bird Areas on the coast of Yemen, but none are officially protected.\n\n\nSee also\nList of ecoregions in Yemen\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\nGoogle books\nBritannica Arabian Desert", "revid": 1275643623, "rev_timestamp": "2025-02-14T06:12:26Z", "source": "enwiki"}

The upper plains of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers dominate most of the ecoregion.  The terrain is mostly open shrub steppe.  The climate is arid (less than 250 mm of precipitation per year).  Evidence is that this region was once more of a forest-steppe, but centuries of overgrazing and gathering firewood have reduced tree and grass cover to small areas and along the riverine corridors.  Despite the degraded condition of the steppe environment, the ecoregion is important for water birds as the rivers and reservoirs provide habitat in the arid region.\n\n\nLocation and description\nMost of the ecoregion is in upper Syria and Iraq, with a thin extension through western Jordan that almost reaches the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, and almost touching the border with Iran in the east.  The terrain is flat plains or hills, with an average elevation of 468 metres (1,535 ft).  The ecoregion to the south is the Mesopotamian shrub desert, and to the north is the Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests ecoregion.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of the ecoregion is Hot semi-arid climates (Köppen climate classification (BSh)). This climate is characteristic of steppes, with hot summers and cool or mild winters, and minimal precipitation.  The coldest month averages above 0 °C (32 °F).  Precipitation averages less than 200 mm/year.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe region is one of shrub steppe, crossed by riverine woodlands in places.  In deep, non-saline soils the dominant shrubs are white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba), associated with bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa).  Stonier soils support Hammada scoparia.  Areas near water support (Tamarix), Euphrates poplar (Populus euphratica), and reeds (Phragmites).    \nIn heavily-vegetated areas with little to no human population, some large mammals are found, including the European badger (Meles meles), wild boar (Sus scrofa), golden jackal (Canis aureus), Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), caracal (Caracal caracal), and the vulnerable Arabian goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa).   \nThe Syrian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemippus) once ranged across the ecoregion but was hunted to extinction by the early 20th century. Similarly, the Arabian ostrich and the Syrian elephant are hypothesised to have inhabited the region in the past but have been extinct for millennia. The large predators of the Arabian Plate, including the lion (Panthera leo), Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus), Arabian wolf (Canis lupus), and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) have been mostly or completely extirpated from over-hunting and habitat loss.\nFor migratory water birds, the Euphrates River valley serves as a major migration route between the wetlands of Turkey and the wetlands of Iraq.  Many of these species depend on a combination of wetlands and arid desert habitat.  Birds in the ecoregion of conservation interest include vulnerable Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), the vulnerable Great bustard (Otis tarda), and the near-threatened little bustard (Tetrax tetrax).\n\n\nProtected areas\nLess than 1% of the ecoregion is officially protected.

{"eco_id": 843, "eco_name": "Taklimakan desert", "wiki_title": "Taklamakan Desert", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taklamakan_Desert", "extract_text": "The Taklamakan Desert ( TAK-lə-mə-KAN) is a desert in northwest China. Located inside the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang, it is bounded by the Kunlun Mountains to the south, the Pamir Mountains to the west, the Tian Shan range to the north, and the Gobi Desert to the east.\n\n\nEtymology\nWhile most researchers agree on makan being the Persian word for \"place\", etymology of Takla is less clear. The word may be a Uyghur borrowing of the Persian tark, \"to leave alone/out/behind, relinquish, abandon\" + makan. Another plausible explanation suggests it is derived from Turki taqlar makan, describing \"the place of ruins\". Chinese scholars Wang Guowei and Huang Wenbi linked the name to the Tocharians, a historical people of the Tarim Basin, making the meaning of \"Taklamakan\" similar to \"Tocharistan\". According to Uyghur researcher Turdi Mettursun Kara, the name Taklamakan comes from the expression Terk-i Mekan. The name is first mentioned as Terk-i Makan (ترك مكان / trk mkan) in the book called Tevarih-i Muskiyun, which was written in 1867 in the Hotan Prefecture of Xinjiang.\nIn folk etymology, it is said to mean \"Place of No Return\" or \"get in and you'll never get out\".\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe Taklamakan Desert has an area of 337,000 km2 (130,000 sq mi), making it slightly smaller than Germany. The desert is part of the Tarim Basin, which is 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) long and 400 kilometres (250 mi) wide. It is crossed at its northern and at its southern edge by two branches of the Silk Road, by which travellers sought to avoid the arid wasteland. It is the world's second-largest shifting sand desert, with about 85% made up of shifting sand dunes, ranking 16th in size in a ranking of the world's largest deserts. Dunes range in height from 60 feet (18 m) up to as much as 300 feet (91 m). The few breaks in this sea of sand are small patches of alluvial clay. Generally, the steeper sides of the dunes face away from the prevailing winds. The Taklamakan, as with all of Outer China, is a land of extremes, with hot summers and cold winters. Sandstorms are likely and dangerous. In many cases, permanent settlement is only by oases.\nThe People's Republic of China has constructed two cross-desert highways. The Tarim Desert Highway links the cities of Hotan (on the southern edge) and Luntai (on the northern edge) and the Bayingol to Ruoqiang road crosses the desert to the east.\nAs a shifting sand desert, sand dunes constantly shift under the influence of the wind. As a result, moving sand dunes erode grasslands and residential areas.\n\n\"When I woke up one morning, I found I couldn't open the door because of the weight of sand that had accumulated overnight. My crops were buried too, so I had no choice but to move\" -Memet Simay, Qira County resident\nThe Golmud-Korla Railway crosses the Taklamakan as well.\nNamed areas in the desert include Ha-la-ma, A-lang-ha and Mai-k'o-tsa-k'o. The Mazartag mountains are located in the western part of the desert.\n\n\nGreen belt\nIn 1978, the Chinese government launched the Green Great Wall project, aiming to create a forest chain extending from Xinjiang to Heilongjiang in northern China, to prevent desertification as well as harness the region's renewable energy potential. It is one of the largest afforestation projects in the world. By 2024, a 3,050-kilometre (1,900-mile) green belt had been completed, encircling the desert with sand-stabilizing vegetation and solar-powered sand control systems.\nThe project involved planting desert poplar, saxaul, and red willow trees, particularly in southern areas like Yutian County. These efforts aim to reduce sandstorms, protect infrastructure, and improve ecological stability.\nThe initiative complements infrastructure developments such as the Hotan–Ruoqiang railway, the first railway loop around a desert and large-scale renewable energy projects. Plans by the China Three Gorges Corporation include the construction of 8.5 gigawatts of solar power and 4 gigawatts of wind energy generation capacity in the region.\n\n\nClimate\n\nBecause it lies in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, the Taklamakan has a cold desert climate. Given its relative proximity with the cold to frigid air masses in Siberia, extreme temperatures are recorded in wintertime, sometimes well below −20 °C (−4 °F), while in summer they can rise up to 40 °C (104 °F). During the 2008 Chinese winter storms episode, the Taklamakan was reported to be covered, for the first time in its recorded history, entirely with a thin layer of snow, reaching 4 centimetres (1.6 in), with a temperature of −26.1 °C (−15 °F) in some observatories.\nIts extreme inland position, effectively at the very center of Asia, and thousands of kilometres from any open body of water, accounts for its somewhat wide diurnal temperature variation.\n\n\nSpring dust storms\nSpring, when wind patterns shift and the especially dry land with minimal vegetation warms rapidly, is peak dust storm season, especially in the southern part of the desert. The sun heats near-surface dust, fueling pockets of convection. Satellite observations by the Japanese Himawari-9 show the dust creeping upward in mountain valleys throughout the day. Data from NASA's MODIS instruments show 1.5% decrease in the amount of atmospheric dust in the area each year since the early 2000s.\n\n\nOasis\n\nThe Taklamakan Desert has very little water, making it hazardous to cross. Merchant caravans on the Silk Road would stop for relief at its thriving oasis towns. It was in close proximity to many ancient civilizations—to the Northwest is the Amu Darya basin, to the southwest the Afghanistan mountain passes lead to Iran and India, to the east is China, and even to the north ancient towns such as Almaty can be found.\nThe key oasis towns, watered by rainfall from the mountains, were Kashgar, Miran, Niya, Yarkand, and Khotan (Hetian) to the south, Kuqa and Turpan in the north, and Loulan and Dunhuang in the east. Now, many sites, such as Miran and Gaochang, stand in ruins, and encompass sparsely inhabited zones in the modern Xinjiang Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China.\nNumerous archaeological treasures have been found in the sand-buried ruins of the Taklamakan. They point to Tocharian, early Hellenistic, Indian, and Buddhist influences. Its treasures and dangers have been vividly described by Aurel Stein, Sven Hedin, Albert von Le Coq, and Paul Pelliot.\nMummies, some dated to as far back as 4000 years, have been found in the region.\nLater, the Taklamakan was inhabited by Turkic peoples. The Indo-European-speaking Tocharians were assimilated by the Turkic Uyghurs who migrated into the Tarim Basin around the 9th century. Starting with the Han dynasty, the Chinese sporadically extended their control to the oasis cities of the Taklamakan Desert to control important silk road trade routes across Central Asia. Periods of Chinese rule were interspersed with rule by Turkic, Mongol and Tibetan peoples. The present population consists largely of Turkic Uyghur people and ethnic Han Chinese.\n\n\nScientific exploration\n\nThis desert was explored by several scholars, including Xuanzang, a 7th-century Buddhist monk, and, in the 20th century, the archaeologist Aurel Stein.\nAtmospheric studies have shown that dust originating from the Taklamakan is blown over the Pacific, where it contributes to cloud formation over the Western United States. Further, the traveling dust redistributes minerals from the Taklamakan to the western U.S. via rainfall. Studies have shown that a specific class of mineral found in the dust, known as K-feldspar, triggers ice formation particularly well. K-feldspar is particularly susceptible to corrosion by acidic atmospheric pollution, such as nitrates and phosphates; exposure to these constituents reduces the ability of the dust to trigger water droplet formation.\nIn May 2023, China announced that it would drill a hole to around 11 kilometres (36,000 ft) depth to investigate the layers of crust in that area. It will not be as deep as the Kola Superdeep Borehole (12,262 metres (40,230 ft).\n\n\nTransportation\n\nThe Taklamakan Desert is surrounded by the Taklamakan Desert railway loop. The Southern Xinjiang Railway branches from the Lanxin Railway near Turpan, follows the north side of the basin to Kashgar, and curves southeast to Khotan, while Hotan–Ruoqiang railway loops around the south and west side of the rail line. In total, the Taklamakan Desert railway loop contains four different railway lines, including the sections of the Golmud–Korla railway, Hotan–Ruoqiang railway, Kashgar–Hotan railway, and Southern Xinjiang railway. Roads and highways are also available in the desert.\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe desert is the main setting for Chinese film series Painted Skin and Painted Skin: The Resurrection. The Chinese TV series Candle in the Tomb is mostly spent in this desert as they are searching for the Niya ruins.\nThe issue No. 39 Soft Places of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman takes place in the desert, when Marco Polo gets lost in the desert.\nA portion of the Korean quasi-historical TV drama series Queen Seondeok takes place in the Taklamakan Desert. Sohwa escapes from Silla with baby Deokman and raises her in the desert. As a teenager, Deokman returns to Silla and uses the knowledge and experience gained from life among international traders in the Taklamakan trading centers to gain the throne of Silla.\nThe desert is showcased in the Japanese animation Mobile Suit Gundam 00, set in the year 2307. On the series, the Taklamakan Desert is the setting of a large-scale military joint operation performed by all the world's blocks of power, and interdicted by the paramilitary organization Celestial Being.\n\n\nSee also\nBezeklik Caves – Buddhist cave grottos in Xinjiang, China\nCities along the Silk Road\nList of deserts by area\nMount Imeon – Ancient name for major Asia massif\nTaklamakania, named for the desert\nTazhong, town at centre of Taklamakan Desert\nTurpan water system – Irrigation system\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\nKara, Turdi Mettursun (March 1, 2022). \"\"Taklamakan\" Adının Kökeni Üzerine\".

{"eco_id": 747, "eco_name": "Tigris-Euphrates alluvial salt marsh", "wiki_title": "Mesopotamian Marshes", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamian_Marshes", "extract_text": "The Mesopotamian Marshes, also known as the Iraqi Marshes, are a wetland area located in southern Iraq and southwestern Iran as well as partially in northern Kuwait. The marshes are primarily located on the floodplains of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers bound by the cities of Basra, Nasiriyah, Amarah and a portion of southwestern Iran and northern Kuwait (particularly Bubiyan Island). Historically the marshlands, mainly composed of the separate but adjacent Central, Hawizeh and Hammar Marshes, used to be the largest wetland ecosystem of western Eurasia. The unique wetland landscape is home to the Marsh people, who have developed a unique culture tightly coupled to the landscape – harvesting reeds and rice, fishing, and herding water buffalo.\nDraining of portions of the marshes began in the 1950s and continued through the 1970s to reclaim land for agriculture and oil exploration. In the late 1980s and 1990s, during the presidency of Saddam Hussein, this work was expanded and accelerated to evict Marsh people from the marshes. Before 2003, the marshes were drained to 10% of their original size. Since the American overthrow of Hussein in 2003, the marshes have partially recovered. However, drought along with upstream dam construction and operation in Turkey, Syria, and Iran have hindered the process. The Mesopotamian marshes were listed as an UNESCO Heritage Site in 2016.\n\n\nGeography\n\nAs its name suggests, the Mesopotamian Marshes are located in the larger region of Mesopotamia. Originally covering an area of 20,000 km2 (7,700 mi2) and divided into three major areas, the Central Marshes lie between the Tigris and Euphrates, while the Hammar Marshes lie south of the Euphrates and the Hawizeh Marshes are bound east of the Tigris. Before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, about 90% of the marshes had been drained.\nThe marshes lie on a flat alluvial plain, as the Euphrates decreases only 12 m (39 ft) in elevation during its last 300 km (190 mi) while the Tigris falls 24 m (79 ft). This delta provides an environment that allows the Tigris and Euphrates to meander, forming distributaries. The Euphrates has often terminated near Nasiriyah into the Hammar Marshes as its flow slows. The Tigris can distribute some of its flow into the Central and Hawizeh marshes as it slows near Amarah. Downstream of Amarah, though, several of its tributaries originating in Iran allow the Tigris's flow to increase, and it maintains a steady course thereafter. The three marshes once provided an intertwined environment, particularly during periods of flooding as the rivers overflowed.\n\n\nCentral\n\nThe Central Marshes receive water from influxes of the Tigris's distributaries, namely the Shatt al-Muminah and Majar al-Kabir south of Amarah. The Tigris serves as the marshes' eastern boundary while the Euphrates serves as its southern boundary. Covering an area of 3,000 km2 (1,200 mi2), the marshes consist of reed beds and several permanent lakes including Umm al Binni lake. The Al-Zikri and Hawr Umm Al-Binni lakes are two of the notable lakes and are 3 m (9.8 ft) deep.\n\n\nHammar\n\nThe Hammar Marshes are primarily fed by the Euphrates and lie south of it with a western extent to Nasiriyah, eastern border of the Shatt al-Arab and southern extent of Basrah. Normally, the marshes are a 2,800 km2 (1,100 mi2) area of permanent marsh and lake but during period of flooding can extend to 4,500 km2 (1,700 mi2). In periods of flooding, water from the Central Marsh, fed by the Tigris can overflow and supply the marshes with water. Hammar Lake is the largest water body within the marsh and has an area of 120 km (75 mi) by 250 km (160 mi), with depths ranging between 1.8 m (5.9 ft)-3 m (9.8 ft). In the summer, large portion of the marshes' and lake's shore are exposed, revealing islands that are used for agriculture.\n\n\nHawizeh\n\nThe Hawizeh Marshes lie east of the Tigris and a portion lie in Iran. The Iranian side of the marshes, known as Hawr Al-Azim, is fed by the Karkheh River, while the Tigris distributaries Al-Musharrah and Al-Kahla supply the Iraqi side, only with much less water than the Karkheh. During spring flooding, the Tigris may directly flow into the marshes. The marshes are drained by the Al-Kassarah. This river plays a critical role in maintaining the Al-Hawizeh marshes as a flow-through system and preventing it from becoming a closed saline basin.\nThe marshes are 80 km (50 mi) from north to south and about 30 km (19 mi) from east to west, covering a total area of 3,000 km2 (1,200 mi2). Permanent portions of the marshes include the northern and central portion while the southern part is generally seasonal. Moderately dense vegetation can be found in the permanent areas along with large 6 m (20 ft)-deep lakes in the northern portions. As the Hawizeh Marshes fared the best during the draining, they can facilitate the reproduction of flora, fauna and other species in Central and Hammar marshes.\n\n\nEcology\n\nThe marshes constitute a flooded grasslands and savannas ecoregion, also known as the Tigris-Euphrates alluvial salt marsh. The ecoregion includes both the Mesopotamian Marshes and the Shadegan Ponds, a wetland on the lower Karun River in neighboring Iran. The marshes are integral to coastal health, filtering out pollutants and waste before they reach the Gulf, though this capacity was significantly degraded after their draining. The marshes also serve as spawning and nursery sites for coastal fish and shrimp species.\nThe seasonal and permanent marshlands are dominated by aquatic plants, including reeds (Phragmites australis), cattail rushes (Typha domingensis), and papyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus). Riparian forests of poplar (mainly Populus euphratica), tamarisk (Tamarix pentandra and Tamarix meyeri), and willow (mainly Salix acmophylla) occur on islands and river banks.\nThe marshes are home to 40 species of bird and several species of fish. It demarcates a range limit for a number of bird species. Flamingos, pelicans and herons inhabit the marshes. The marshes were once home to a large number of birds and the stopover for many other migratory birds as they traveled from Siberia to Africa. At risk are 40% to 60% of the world's marbled teal population that live in the marshes, along with 90% of the world's population of Basra reed-warbler. Also at risk are the sacred ibis and African darter. A subspecies of the hooded crow known as the Mesopotamian crow is found in this part of southern Iraq. Seven species are now extinct from the marshes, including the Indian crested porcupine, the Bunn's short-tailed bandicoot rat and the marsh gray wolf. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.\nConsiderable confusion has existed relating to the status of the Eurasian otter and the endemic maxwelli subspecies of the smooth-coated otter in the region, but recent surveys have confirmed that both still survive.\n\n\nInhabitants\n\nMaʻdān live in secluded villages of elaborate reed houses throughout the marshes, often only reached by boat. Fish, rice cultivation, water buffalo and other resources are also used in their daily lives. In the 1950s, there were an estimated 500,000 Marsh Arabs. This population shrank to about 20,000 following the draining and Saddam's violent reprisals, and between 80,000 and 120,000 fled to neighboring Iran. Following the 2003 Iraq invasion, Marsh Arabs have begun to return to the marshes. Many hacked down the dikes and dams that Saddam had built.\nThe Iraqi government has provided support via channels like the Iraq Cultural Health Fund, which funds Marsh Arabs in their efforts to protect traditional cultural practices. Nevertheless, Marsh Arabs remain one of Iraq’s most underserved populations, struggling to obtain healthcare, clean drinking water, and adequate nutrition.\nAs the marshes become increasingly saline and polluted, many Marsh Arabs are once again being forced to relocate. For those who remain, their traditional lifestyle is threatened. The marshes supplied 60 percent of Iraq’s fish; that number has dwindled to the single digits. This, combined with the lack of potable water for raising water buffalo, is driving some Marsh Arabs to marsh perimeters, where they farm grain.\n\n\nHistory\n\nIn the 4th millennium BCE, the first literate societies emerged in Southern Mesopotamia, often referred to as the \"Cradle of Civilization\", and the first cities and complex state bureaucracies were developed there during the Uruk period. Due to the geographical location and ecological factors of the Fertile Crescent, a crescent-shape fertile area running from the basins of the Nile in Egypt, northwards along the Mediterranean coast in Palestine and Israel, and southwards again along the Euphrates and the Tigris towards the Persian Gulf, civilizations were able to develop agricultural and technological programmes. The crucial trigger was the availability of wild edible plant species. Farming arose early in the Fertile Crescent because the area had a large quantity of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate.\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries, the marshes were the site of the state of Batihah founded by 'Imran ibn Shahin.\n\n\nDraining and subsequent restoration efforts\n\nThe draining of Mesopotamian Marshes began in the 1950s with the Central Marshes and gradually accelerated as it affected the two other main marshes until early in the 21st century with the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The draining of the marshes was intended at first to reclaim land for agriculture along with oil exploration but later served as a punishment for Shia Arabs in response to the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The draining of the marshes was largely due to dams, dykes and other diversion structures constructed into Iraq but were exacerbated by upstream dam construction in Syria and Turkey.\nWhile the British engineers worked with the Iraqi government, Frank Haigh developed the Haigh Report in 1951. His report recommended a complex of canals, sluices, and dykes on the lower portions of both the Tigris and Euphrates. These water control structures could be used to drain marshes therefore creating profitable farmland. In 1953, construction began on the Third River or Main Outfall Drain and later the Saddam River which would drain water from the Central Marsh under the Euphrates and through a canal eventually into the Persian Gulf. Work on the Third River and other draining projects, particularly for the Hawizeh Marsh, quickly progressed in the 1980s during the Iran–Iraq War in order to afford Iraqis a tactical advantage in the marshes. Part of the Hammar Marshes was also drained in 1985 to clear area for oil exploration.\nAfter the 1991 Gulf War, Shia Muslims in southern Iraq rebelled against Saddam Hussein, who in turn crushed the rebellion and further accelerated the draining of the Central and Hammar marshes in order to evict Shias that have taken refuge in the marshes. With the exception of the Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station, the 565 km (351 mi) Third River was completed in 1992 and two other canals were constructed south and nearly parallel to it. One, the Mother of Battles canal, was constructed to divert the flow of the Euphrates south below the Hammar Marsh. Second, the 240 km (150 mi) Loyalty to Leader Canal also known as the Basrah Sweetwater Canal, which originates in the lower Euphrates region, collected water from the terminus of the Gharraf River and diverted it under the Euphrates, away from the Central Marshes and below the Hammar Marshes towards Basrah. The Glory River was also constructed to divert water from the Tigris's southern-flowing distributaries east and parallel along the Tigris until they reached the Euphrates near its confluence with the Tigris at Qurna.\nBy the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the marshes had lost 90% of their size from the previous decades. The Central and Hammar Marshes were nearly drained and only 35% of the Hawizeh Marshes remained. After the invasion, locals destroyed dikes. The combined efforts of the Iraq government, United Nations, U.S. agencies and record precipitation in Turkey helped begin a restoration of the marshes. As of late 2006, 58% of the original marshes had been reinundated. The Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station was completed in 2009, affording the Third River to be used for agricultural drainage. Recent drought and continued upstream dam construction and operation in Turkey, Syria, and Iran have reduced the marshes to around 30% of their original size by 2009. Turkey has built at least 34 dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, threatening marsh recovery.\nFrom a high of around 75% restored in 2008, the wetlands receded to 58% of their average pre-drained level by spring 2015. Meanwhile, as the water level fell, salinity increased to 15,000 parts per million in some areas, up from 300 to 500 ppm in the 1980s. \"When the river water levels were high, the low-saline Tigris washed over the marshes, cleansed them, and pushed the salty residue into the saltier Euphrates, which flows along the western edge. But now the Tigris is so low that the Euphrates provides most of the water in the marshes.\"\nThe government prioritizes providing water to cities along the Tigris and the Shatt al-Arab, resulting in reduced flow to the marshes.\n\n\nThreats from climate change and pollution\nTemperatures in the region have risen over 0.5 degrees Celsius per decade, causing drought in Iraq and in neighbors whose waters flow into the Tigris and Euphrates. Combined with upriver dams, this reduction in water has caused the three primary marshes to fragment into ten smaller marshes.\nMassive amounts of untreated sewage and other pollutants are dumped into the Tigris and Euphrates, moving downstream into the marshes and further degrading the water quality.\n\n\nSee also\n\nBattle of the Marshes\nTigris–Euphrates river system\nShatt al-Arab\nGeography of Iraq\n\n\nReferences\n\nU.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 2008.

It is part of the Amazon biome.\nThe ecoregion contains the city of Belém, capital of the state of Pará. \nIt is the most developed part of the Amazon region, and is one of the most severely degraded natural habitats of the region.\n\n\nLocation\nThe Tocantins–Araguaia–Maranhão moist forests ecoregion is the most eastern of the Amazon region.\nIt covers the east of the state of Pará and the north of Maranhão.\nThe main cities are Belém, Paragominas and Bragança.\nIts western border is the Tocantins River, a tributary of the Amazon River.\nIt is bordered by the mouth of the Amazon to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast.\nThe southern border is defined by the Mearim River.\nTo the east it is bounded by the Pindaré River and the Baía de São Marcos.\nThe Marajó várzea at the mouth of the Amazon lies to the north.\nThere is a belt of Amazon–Orinoco–Southern Caribbean mangroves along the Atlantic coast to the northeast.\nTo the southeast the ecoregion adjoins the Maranhão Babaçu forests.\nIn the south it meets the Cerrado ecoregion and elements of the Mato Grosso seasonal forests.\nTo the west it adjoins the Xingu–Tocantins–Araguaia moist forests on the other side of the Tocantins River.\n\n\nPhysical\nMost of the region is an alluvial plain formed by the Amazon river.\nThe Serra do Tiracambu and Serra do Gurupi in the southwest are low hills less than 200 metres (660 ft) high.\nThe Gurupí, Capim, and the whitewater Guamá rivers flow into the mouth of the Amazon and are affected by the daily tides, which force water from the Amazon upstream.\nThe Mearim and Pindaré empty into the Atlantic Ocean. \nSoils are mainly low in nutrients and consist of deeply weathered clay.\n\n\nEcology\nThe ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Köppen climate classification is \"Am\": equatorial, monsoonal.\nTemperatures are fairly steady throughout the year, slightly cooler in August and slightly warmer in April.\nAverage temperatures range from 22 °C (72 °F) to 32 °C (90 °F) with a mean temperature of 27.5 °C (81.5 °F).\nThe ecoregion experiences a dry season for five months of each year, with monthly rainfall of less than 100 millimetres (3.9 in).\nThis is most marked in the northwest of Maranhão.\nRainfall is lowest in September, with less than 50 millimetres (2.0 in), and greatest in March, with over 375 millimetres (14.8 in).\nDuring the wet season the streams and rivers expand and flood the low lying regions.\nAnnual rainfall is about 2,500 millimetres (98 in) in the north, and 1,500 millimetres (59 in) in the drier south where the moist forest merges into cerrado shrubland.\n\n\nFlora\nThe ecoregion may be a diversification center for many taxa of trees, and in the past the west of the region may have been a refugium.\nThere is a wide variety of species in the dense evergreen rainforest due to the many rivers and to the transitional nature of the flora between the Amazon basin and the drier southern vegetation.\nThe ecoregion contains flooded forests and terra firme forests.\nThe flooded forests are either igapó, flooded daily by clear blackwater rivers, or várzea, flooded daily by whitewater rivers that take their color from suspended soil and organic matter.\nThe igapó forests are adapted to acidic white sand soils that are poor in nutrients.\nThe trees are lower and less diverse than in the terra firme forests.\nCommon species in the igapó and várzea include Caraipa grandiflora, Virola surinamensis, Euterpe oleraceae, Ficus pulchella, Mauritia martiana, Symphonia globulifera, and members of the Tovomita and Clusia genera.\nThe most common families in the terra firme forests are Lecythidaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Lauraceae and Sapotaceae. \nTree species include Lecythis odora, Lecythis turbinata, Cenostigma tocantina, Bombax tocantinum, and Bauhinia bombaciflora, a large liana. \nThe legume Vouacapoua americana is the most important timber tree, growing only in the east of the Amazon region.\nBrazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is uncommon in the region and there are few orchids.\nThe threatened mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) may be found along the upper Capim and Guamá rivers.\nOther rare or threatened trees include Pilocarpus microphyllus and Dicypellium caryophyllatum.\n\n\nFauna\n149 species of mammals have been recorded, of which over 80 are bats.\nMammals include red-handed howler (Alouatta belzebul), red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus),  Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus).\nEndangered mammals include white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).\nThere are more than 76 species of snakes. \nThe rivers have many fish and  aquatic reptiles.\nEndangered reptiles include green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) and Maranhão slider (Trachemys adiutrix).\n\n517 species of birds have been recorded, including two species of heron that are uncommon in other parts of the Amazon region, tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor) and yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea).\nOther birds include toucans (genus Ramphastos), red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), white-crested guan (Penelope pileata),  parrots, parakeets and many migrant birds from the Nearctic realm.\nEndangered birds include red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis).\n\n\nStatus\nThe Tapajós–Xingu, Xingu–Tocantins–Araguaia, and Tocantins–Araguaia–Maranhão moist forests ecoregions on the eastern edge of the Amazon basin have all been badly affected by human settlement and deforestation.\nThe Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia ecoregion is one of the most developed in the Amazon region, with most of the habitat threatened by cities and highways.\nThere are large industrial and agricultural developments along the roads and colonization along the rivers.\nThe Tucuruí Dam on the Tocantins below Marabá flooded 2,430 square kilometres (940 sq mi) of low-lying forest. \nOver a third of the forests have been cleared, often leaving degraded land.\nThe result is a patchwork of forest remnants, secondary forests, fields, pastures and urban sprawl.\nFires are often used to clear land, threatening the remaining forest ecosystems with their many rare species.\nSeedlings of rainforest trees cannot grow in the dry and eroded pastures, so forest regeneration is difficult.\nDuring the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.51%.\nGlobal warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall.\nLow, flat and deforested ecoregions such as the Tocantins/Pindare moist forests are extremely vulnerable.\nThere are a number of small protected areas.\nThe Caxiuanã National Forest covers 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi) and offers a degree of protection.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Tocantins-Pindare Moist Forests Ecoregion at Wikimedia Commons", "revid": 1316731290,

The archipelago has a total area of 10.4 square kilometres (4.0 square miles) and a navy-supported research station of up to 8 persons. The archipelago consists of five islands and several rocks and stacks; Trindade is the largest island, with an area of 10.1 square kilometres (3.9 square miles); about 49 kilometres (30 miles) east of it are the tiny Martim Vaz islets, with a total area of 0.3 square kilometres (70 acres).\nThe islands are of volcanic origin and have rugged terrain; the date of last eruption in the island is unknown, but occurred on the southeastern tip of the island at Vulcão de Paredão. They are largely barren, except for the southern part of Trindade. They were discovered in 1502 by Portuguese explorer Estêvão da Gama and stayed Portuguese until they became part of Brazil at its independence in 1822. From 1895 to 1896, Trindade was occupied by the United Kingdom until an agreement with Brazil was reached. During the period of British occupation, Trindade was known as South Trinidad.\nThe islands are situated some 2,100 kilometres (1,300 miles) southwest of Ascension Island and 2,550 kilometres (1,580 miles) west of Saint Helena, and the distance to the west coast of Africa is 4,270 kilometres (2,650 miles).\nDue the introduction of invasive species, such as sheep, the island's biodiversity has heavily deteriorated since the second half of the 20th century, with many indigenous species having become endangered.\n\n\nGeography\nThe individual islands with their respective locations are given in the following:\n\nIlha da Trindade (Portuguese for \"Trinity Island\") (20°31′30″S 29°19′30″W)\nIlhas de Martim Vaz (20°30′00″S 28°51′00″W)\nIlha do Norte (\"North Island\"), 300 metres (980 feet) north-northwest of Ilha da Racha, 75 metres (246 feet) high.

(20°30′18″S 29°20′42″W)\nRochedo da Agulha (\"Needle Rock\"), a flat circular rock 200 metres (660 feet) northwest of Ilha da Racha, is 60 metres (200 feet) high.\nIlha do Sul (\"South Island\"), 1,600 metres (5,200 feet) south of Ilha da Racha, is a rocky pinnacle. Ilha do Sul is the easternmost point of Brazil. (20°31′00″S 28°51′00″W)\n\n\nTrindade\n\nTrindade is a mountainous, desiccated volcanic island. The highest summit is Pico Desejado, near the center, 620 metres (2,030 feet) high. Nearby to the northwest are Pico da Trindade (590 m (1,940 ft)) and Pico Bonifácio (570 m (1,870 ft)). Pico Monumento, a remarkable peak in the form of a slightly inclined cylinder, rises from the west coast to 270 m (890 ft).\nUntil around 1850, between 75 and 85% of the island was covered by a forest of Colubrina glandulosa trees, 15m in height and 40 cm trunk diameter. The introduction of non-native animals (like goats, pigs, sheep, etc.), and the indiscriminate cutting of trees, led to total extirpation of the forest, causing heavy erosion on the island, with a loss of about 1 to 2 meters of fertile soils. The effect of this devastation impaired the flow of water streams, with the depletion of several springs.\nThere is a small settlement in the north on the shore of a cove called Enseada dos Portugueses, supporting a garrison of the Brazilian Navy, 32 strong.\nThe archipelago is the main nesting site of the green sea turtle in Brazil. There are also large numbers of breeding seabirds, including the endemic subspecies of the Great frigatebird (Fregata minor nicolli) and Lesser frigatebird (F. ariel trinitatis), and it is the only Atlantic breeding site for the Trindade petrel. Humpback whales have been confirmed to use the Trindade island as a nursery.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n16th to 18th century\nThe Trindade and Martim Vaz Islands were discovered in 1502 by Portuguese navigators led by Estêvão da Gama, and along with Brazil, became part of the Portuguese Empire.\nMany visitors have been to Martim Vaz, the most famous of whom was the English astronomer Edmund Halley, who took possession of the island on behalf of the British Monarchy in 1700. Wild goats and hogs, descendants of ones set free by Halley, were still found on Martim Vaz in 1939.\n\nHMS Rattlesnake, a 198-ton, 12-gun cutter-rigged sloop, was wrecked on Trindade on 21 October 1781, shortly after Commander Philippe d'Auvergne had taken over command. Rattlesnake had been ordered to survey the island to ascertain whether it would make a useful base for outward-bound Indiamen. She anchored, but that evening the wind increased and by seven o’clock she was dragging. Two hours later the first cable parted and Commander d’Auvergne club-hauled his way out, setting main and fore sails, and using the remaining anchor cable as a spring. This successfully put Rattlesnake’s head to seaward. The remaining cable was then cut, and the sloop wore round and stood out to sea. However the ground now shallowed quite rapidly and suddenly Rattlesnake struck a submerged rock. She started filling with water, so, in order to preserve the lives of the crew, d'Auvergne ran her ashore. Commodore Johnstone on board HMS Jupiter had previously wished to colonise the island and claim it for Britain, so d'Auvergne agreed to stay on the tiny island with 30 sailors, 20 captured French sailors, one French woman, some animals and supplies. They were resupplied by another ship in January 1782, then they appear to have been forgotten, as they lived on the tiny island for a year until HMS Bristol and a convoy of Indiamen, which fortuitously called there, rescued them in late December 1782.\nJohnstone had made a naval base in Trindade, so Portugal reacted. They sent the 64-gun Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres, commanded by Captain of sea and war José de Melo, with 150 soldiers and artillery, but the British had already abandoned the Island.\nFrench French Navy officer and explorer La Pérouse stopped there at the outset of his renowned 1785 voyage to the Pacific.\n\n\n19th to 20th century\n\nIn 1839, the Ross expedition made a brief stop on Trindade, as chronicled by Robert McCormick. He described Pico Monumento as the \"Nine Pin Rock\".\nIn 1889, Edward Frederick Knight went treasure hunting on the island. He was unsuccessful but he wrote a detailed description of the island and his expedition, titled The Cruise of the Alerte.\nIn 1893 another Franco-American, James Harden-Hickey, claimed the island and declared himself as James I, Prince of Trinidad. According to James Harden-Hickey's plans, Trinidad, after being recognized as an independent country, would become a military dictatorship and have him as dictator. He designed postage stamps, a national flag, and a coat of arms; established a chivalric order, the \"Cross of Trinidad\"; bought a schooner to transport colonists; appointed M. le Comte de la Boissiere as secretary of state; opened a consular office at 217 West 36th Street in New York City; and even issued government bonds to finance construction of infrastructure on the island. Despite his plans, his idea was ridiculed or ignored by the world.\nIn July 1895, the British again tried to take possession of this strategic position in the Atlantic. The British planned to use the island as a cable station. However, Brazilian diplomatic efforts, along with Portuguese support, reinstated Trindade Island to Brazilian sovereignty.\n\nIn order to clearly demonstrate sovereignty over the island, now part of the State of Espírito Santo and the municipality of Vitória, a landmark was built on 24 January 1897. Nowadays, Brazilian presence is marked by a permanent Brazilian Navy base on the main island.\nIn July 1910 the ship Terra Nova carrying the last expedition of Captain Robert Falcon Scott to the Antarctic arrived at the island, at the time uninhabited. Some members of Scott's expedition explored the island with scientific purposes, and a description of it is included in The Worst Journey in the World, by Apsley Cherry-Garrard, one of the members of the expedition.\nIn August 1914, the Imperial German Navy established a supply base for its warships off Trindade. On 14 September 1914, the Royal Navy auxiliary cruiser HMS Carmania fought the German SMS Cap Trafalgar off Trindade in the Battle of Trindade. Carmania sank Cap Trafalgar, but sustained severe damage herself.\n\n\n21st century\nTrindade was a port passing mark for the 2022 Golden Globe Race, a single-handed round-the-world yacht race. In March 2023, plastic rocks called plastistone were found on Trindade.\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\nTrindade hotspot\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\nAlves, RJV; da Silva, NG; Aguirre-Muñoz, A (2011). \"Return of endemic plant populations on Trindade Island, Brazil, with comments on the fauna\" (PDF).

It has an area of 1,185,632 square kilometres (457,775 sq mi), covering portions of Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Angola.\n\n\nClimate\nThe dry miombo woodlands have a seasonal tropical climate. Average annual rainfall ranges from 600 to 1,000 mm. The woodlands have a summer rainy season from November to April, when the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moves over the region and brings moisture-bearing northeasterly winds. The May to October dry season is cooler, dominated by southeasterly trade winds. In central and northern Tanzania, which are closer to the equator, the rainfall pattern is more bimodal, with a long, more intense wet season from March to May and a shorter, less intense wet season from October to December.\n\n\nFlora\nDry miombo is an open woodland of mostly deciduous trees, typically less than 15 meters tall with 30 to 60% cover. There shrubs and saplings form a discontinuous understory along with scattered understory trees, and grasses, forbs and subshrubs at ground level. Small seasonally-wet grasslands, known as dambos, grow in areas with poor drainage, and riverine forests grow along rivers. Termite mounds and rock outcrops support distinct plant communities.\nSpecies of Brachystegia (miombo) and Julbernardia, mainly Brachystegia spiciformis  and Julbernardia globiflora, are the predominant trees in miombo woodland. Other common tree species are Uapaca kirkiana, Brachystegia boehmii, Monotes glaber, Faurea saligna, and Combretum molle. Other associated trees include species of Aganope, Afzelia, Burkea, Erythrophleum, Ficus, Monotes, Pterocarpus, Swartzia, and Uapaca.\n\n\nFauna\nThe dry miombo woodlands are home to large mammals, including African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), plains zebra (Equus quagga), greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), common eland (Taurotragus oryx), and Sharpe's grysbok (Raphicerus sharpei), and the carnivores lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Many grazing species rely on adjacent ecoregions, whether forests or flooded grasslands, to provide seasonal food, water, and/or shelter during dry season droughts and fires.\nThe ecoregion is rich in bird species, with few endemic species. Stierling's woodpecker (Dendropicos stierlingi) is a near-endemic species, native to the eastern dry miombo woodlands of southern Tanzania, southwestern Malawi, and northern Mozambique.

{"eco_id": 628, "eco_name": "Rapa Nui and Sala y Gómez subtropical forests", "wiki_title": "Easter Island", "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island", "extract_text": "Geography\n\nEaster Island is one of the world's most isolated inhabited islands. Its closest inhabited neighbour is Pitcairn Island, to the west, with approximately 50 inhabitants. The nearest continental point lies in central Chile near Concepción, at . Easter Island's latitude is similar to that of Caldera, Chile, and it lies west of continental Chile at its nearest point (between Lota and Lebu in the Biobío Region). Isla Salas y Gómez, to the east, is closer but is uninhabited. The Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the southern Atlantic competes for the title of the most remote island, lying from Saint Helena island and from the South African coast.\n\nThe island is about long by at its widest point; its overall shape is triangular. It has an area of , and a maximum elevation of above mean sea level. There are three Rano (freshwater crater lakes), at Rano Kau, Rano Raraku and Rano Aroi, near the summit of Terevaka, but no permanent streams or rivers.\n\nGeology\nthumb|Typical landscape on Easter Island; rounded extinct volcanoes covered in low vegetation.\nEaster Island is a volcanic island, consisting mainly of three extinct coalesced volcanoes: Terevaka (altitude 507 metres) forms the bulk of the island, while two other volcanoes, Poike and Rano Kau, form the eastern and southern headlands and give the island its roughly triangular shape. Lesser cones and other volcanic features include the crater Rano Raraku, the cinder cone Puna Pau and many volcanic caves including lava tubes. Poike used to be a separate island until volcanic material from Terevaka united it to the larger whole. The island is dominated by hawaiite and basalt flows which are rich in iron and show affinity with igneous rocks found in the Galápagos Islands.\n350px|thumb|Easter Island or Rapa Nui and Isla Salas y Gómez|Salas y Gómez Island, Chile, its [[territorial waters and its extended continental shelf. ]]\n\nEaster Island and surrounding islets, such as Motu Nui and Motu Iti, form the summit of a large volcanic mountain rising over from the sea bed. The mountain is part of the Salas y Gómez Ridge, a (mostly submarine) mountain range with dozens of seamounts, formed by the Easter hotspot. The range begins with Pukao and next Moai, two seamounts to the west of Easter Island, and extends east to the Nazca Ridge. The ridge was formed by the Nazca Plate moving over the Easter hotspot.\n\nLocated about east of the East Pacific Rise, Easter Island lies within the Nazca Plate, bordering the Easter Microplate. The Nazca-Pacific relative plate movement due to the seafloor spreading, amounts to about per year. This movement over the Easter hotspot has resulted in the Easter Seamount Chain, which merges into the Nazca Ridge further to the east. Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez are surface representations of that chain. The chain has progressively younger ages to the west. The current hotspot location is speculated to be west of Easter Island, amidst the Ahu, Umu and Tupa submarine volcanic fields and the Pukao and Moai seamounts.\n\nEaster Island lies atop the Rano Kau Ridge, and consists of three shield volcanoes with parallel geologic histories. Poike and Rano Kau exist on the east and south slopes of Terevaka, respectively. Rano Kau developed between 0.78 and 0.46 Ma from tholeiitic to alkalic basalts. This volcano possesses a clearly defined summit caldera. Benmoreitic lavas extruded about the rim from 0.35 to 0.34 Ma. Finally, between 0.24 and 0.11 Ma, a fissure developed along a NE–SW trend, forming monogenetic vents and rhyolitic intrusions. These include the cryptodome islets of Motu Nui and Motu Iti, the islet of Motu Kao Kao, the sheet intrusion of Te Kari Kari, the perlitic obsidian Te Manavai dome and the Maunga Orito dome.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, steam reportedly came out of the Rano Kau crater wall. This was photographed by the island's manager, Mr. Edmunds.\n\nThe ancient Easter Island residents captured fresh groundwater where it seeped into the sea.\n\nClimate\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, the climate of Easter Island is classified as a tropical rainforest climate (Af) that borders on a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). The lowest temperatures are recorded in July and August (minimum ) and the highest in February (maximum temperature ), the summer season in the southern hemisphere. Winters are relatively mild. The rainiest month is May, though the island experiences year-round rainfall. Easter Island's isolated location exposes it to winds which help to keep the temperature fairly cool. Precipitation averages per year. Occasionally, heavy rainfall and rainstorms strike the island. These occur mostly in the winter months (June–August). Since it is close to the South Pacific High and outside the range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, cyclones and hurricanes do not occur around Easter Island. There is significant temperature moderation due to its isolated position in the middle of the ocean.\n\nEcology\nEaster Island, together with its closest neighbour, the tiny island of Isla Salas y Gómez farther east, is recognized by ecologists as a distinct ecoregion, the Rapa Nui tropical broadleaf forests.\n\nThe loss of the palms to make the settlements led to their extinction almost 350 years ago. The toromiro tree (Sophora toromiro) was prehistorically present on Easter Island, but is now extinct in the wild. However, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Göteborg Botanical Garden are jointly leading a scientific program to reintroduce the toromiro to Easter Island. With the palm and the toromiro virtually gone, there was considerably less rainfall as a result of less condensation. After the island was used to feed thousands of sheep for almost a century, by the mid-1900s the island was mostly covered in grassland with nga'atu or bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus tatora) in the crater lakes of Rano Raraku and Rano Kau. The presence of these reeds, which are called totora in the Andes, was used to support the argument of a South American origin of the statue builders, but pollen analysis of lake sediments shows these reeds have grown on the island for over 30,000 years. Before the arrival of humans, Easter Island had vast seabird colonies containing probably over 30 resident species, perhaps the world's richest. Such colonies are no longer found on the main island. Fossil evidence indicates six species of land birds (two rails, two parrots, one owl, and one heron), all of which have become extinct. Five introduced species of land bird are known to have breeding populations (see List of birds of Easter Island).\n\nLack of studies results in poor understanding of the oceanic fauna of Easter Island and waters in its vicinity; however, possibilities of undiscovered breeding grounds for humpback, southern blue and pygmy blue whales including Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez have been considered. Potential breeding areas for fin whales have been detected off northeast of the island as well.\n\nFile:Easter Island ESA419941 (cropped, lightened).jpg|Satellite view of Easter Island 2019.

The drug is also known as rapamycin, after Rapa Nui. It is now being studied for extending longevity in mice.\n\nTrees are sparse, rarely forming natural groves, and it has been argued whether native Easter Islanders deforested the island in the process of erecting their statues, and in providing sustenance for an overconsumption of natural resources from a overcrowded island. Experimental archaeology demonstrated that some statues certainly could have been placed on Y-shaped wooden frames called miro manga erua and then pulled to their final destinations on ceremonial sites. Rapa Nui traditions metaphorically refer to spiritual power (mana) as the means by which the moai were \"walked\" from the quarry. Recent experimental recreations have proven that it is fully possible that the moai were literally walked from their quarries to their final positions by use of ropes, casting doubt on the role that their existence plays in the environmental collapse of the island.\n\nGiven the island's southern latitude, the climatic effects of the Little Ice Age (about 1650 to 1850) may have exacerbated deforestation, although this remains speculative. point to the climatic downtrend caused by the Little Ice Age as a contributing factor to resource stress and to the palm tree's disappearance. Experts, however, do not agree on when the island's palms became extinct.\n\nJared Diamond dismisses past climate change as a dominant cause of the island's deforestation in his book Collapse which assesses the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders. Influenced by Heyerdahl's romantic interpretation of Easter's history, Diamond insists that the disappearance of the island's trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th centuries, alongside declines of fish bones in middens (suggesting a decline in fishing) and then declines in bird bones, which he attributes to habitat loss. He notes that they stopped making statues at that time and started destroying the ahu. But the link is weakened because the Bird Man cult continued to thrive and survived the great impact caused by the arrival of explorers, whalers, sandalwood traders, and slave raiders.\n\nBenny Peiser using the labor of islanders and wooden levers.}}\n\nEaster Island has suffered from heavy soil erosion in recent centuries, aggravated by massive historic deforestation alongside modern sheep farming throughout most of the 20th century. Jakob Roggeveen reported that Easter Island was exceptionally fertile. \"Fowls are the only animals they keep. They cultivate bananas, sugar cane, and above all sweet potatoes.\" In 1786 Jean-François de La Pérouse visited Easter Island and his gardener declared that \"three days' work a year\" would be enough to support the population. Rollin, a major in the Pérouse expedition, wrote, \"Instead of meeting with men exhausted by famine... I found, on the contrary, a considerable population, with more beauty and grace than I afterwards met in any other island; and a soil, which, with very little labor, furnished excellent provisions, and in an abundance more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.\" The islanders' innovation of lithic mulching – the practice of covering fields with gravel or rocks to trap moisture and improve soil fertility – is a well-known and effective practice in dry areas of the premodern world.\n\nAccording to Diamond, the oral traditions (the veracity of which has been questioned by Routledge, Lavachery, Mètraux, Peiser, and others) of the current islanders seem obsessed with cannibalism, which he offers as evidence supporting a rapid collapse. For example, he states, to severely insult an enemy one would say, \"The flesh of your mother sticks between my teeth.\" This, Diamond asserts, means the food supply of the people ultimately ran out. Cannibalism, however, was widespread across Polynesian cultures. Human bones have not been found in earth ovens other than those behind the religious platforms, indicating that cannibalism in Easter Island was a ritualistic practice. Contemporary ethnographic research has proven there is scarcely any tangible evidence for widespread cannibalism anywhere and at any time on the island. The first scientific exploration of Easter Island (1914) recorded that the indigenous population strongly rejected allegations that they or their ancestors had been cannibals.", "revid": 1332339230, "rev_timestamp": "2026-01-11T07:44:00Z", "source": "enwiki"}

It is located in the eastern United States and stretches about 900 miles from New York to Alabama. The province starts in Rockland County, New York near South Mountain on the west side of the Hudson River. \n\nThe eastern border of the Piedmont runs along a fall line, the point at which rivers traditionally drop rapidly from harder metamorphic rocks to softer sedimentary rocks. Because the fall line is the spot where rivers become unnavigable, port cities typically have sprung up where rivers cross this boundary. The east side of the Piedmont runs along the Hudson, parallel to Manhattan, New York City, through New Jersey, and then along a line near Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Richmond, Virginia, Raleigh, North Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, Augusta, Georgia, Macon, Georgia, and Montgomery, Alabama. Richmond and Raleigh are both located within the boundaries of the Piedmont. The west side of the Piedmont runs through lesser populated areas, from south of Harrisburg to Lake Martin in Elmore County, Alabama.\n\nThere are two sections of the Piedmont. The primary portion is called the Uplands section. There are two unconnected sections of the province, known as the lowlands, in the New York City and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania areas.\n\nThe Piedmont is characterized by rolling hills and valleys that are underlain by crystalline metamorphic rocks. The Piedmont is a region of great geological diversity. It is underlain by a variety of rocks that range in age from Precambrian to Cenozoic. The oldest rocks in the Piedmont are gneisses and schists that formed more than a billion years ago during the Grenville orogeny. These rocks were later intruded by granites and other igneous rocks during the Paleozoic era. During the Mesozoic era, the Piedmont was covered by shallow seas that deposited layers of sandstone, shale, and limestone. These sedimentary rocks were later deformed and uplifted during the Cenozoic era. \n\nThe Piedmont is also home to several important mineral resources. The region has long been known for its deposits of gold, which were mined extensively during the 19th century. Other important minerals found in the Piedmont include copper, iron, mica, and granite.", "revid": 1332244344, "rev_timestamp": "2026-01-10T19:21:00Z", "source": "enwiki"}
