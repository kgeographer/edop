PROMPT 11 Jan 2026

I have a copy of WHG data that's a year old, but may suit. It lives in a database 'whgv3beta' (same connection)
relevant tables for use in a edop_gaz include 

places (1.5m rows with a 'P' in fclasses; 61k have an 'S')
	id
	title (name)
	ccodes (array of iso country codes)
	fclasses (array of single letter geonames feature classes, eg P, S, A, etc.)
place_geom
	place_id (-> places.id)
	geom
place_name (huge - 1.1G; 4.3m rows)
	place_id (-> places.id)
	toponym


CREATE TABLE places (
	id int8 GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY( INCREMENT BY 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807 START 1 CACHE 1 NO CYCLE) NOT NULL,
	title varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	src_id varchar(2044) NOT NULL,
	ccodes _varchar NOT NULL,
	minmax _int4 NULL,
	timespans jsonb NULL,
	fclasses _varchar NULL,
	indexed bool NOT NULL,
	flag bool NOT NULL,
	review_wd int4 NULL,
	review_tgn int4 NULL,
	review_whg int4 NULL,
	dataset varchar(20) NOT NULL,
	attestation_year int4 NULL,
	idx_pub bool NOT NULL,
	idx_builder bool NULL,
	create_date timestamptz NULL,
	CONSTRAINT places_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)




===========
it is now 11 Jan here in Santa Fe. some housekeeping, then some baby steps, then a couple of bigger ones as session limits allow.
in the edop database there are some table naming issues that obscure their nature. I need to develop a project markdown doc that can remind me (and Claude Code so I don't waste tokens between sessions) and be updated at the end of sessions. I think the RESULT TABLES section can be updated session_log_*.md files, please do that if possible.

we should keep in mind one of the next tasks is to cluster the basin08 features based on the 1561 dimensions selected for signatures, developed as noted in the session_log_3Jan2026.md file

The sequence of computational work done, with pointers to tables and file outputs

- environmental signatures for 20 WH sites described in docs/session_log_3Jan2026.md
- text embedding signatures for 20 WH sites described in docs/session_log_5Jan2026.md & docs/session_log_6Jan2026.md
- scale text embeddings from 20 WH sites to 258 WH cities described in docs/session_log_7Jan2026.md
- environmental analysis pipeline for 258 WH cities described in docs/session_log_8Jan2026.md
